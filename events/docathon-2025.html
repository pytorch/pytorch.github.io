<p>The PyTorch Docathon 2025, akin to a hackathon, is an event dedicated to enhancing the quality of the PyTorch documentation with the invaluable assistance of our community. This is an inclusive event designed to be accessible to all levels of expertise, from newcomers to experienced ML/PyTorch users. It offers a rewarding experience as participants can see the direct impact of their contributions on the projectâ€™s usability and accessibility. The Docathon promotes a collaborative environment, allowing participants to work with other contributors and PyTorch maintainers, fostering the exchange of ideas and networking. It also provides a rich learning experience, offering the opportunity to explore PyTorch modules, update docstrings, and test tutorials.</p>
