</a></p>

<p>Join us for an engaging webinar on our innovative transfer learning approach using self-supervised Vision Transformers (DINOv2) for multi-label plant species classification in the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge. We’ll cover how we efficiently extract feature embeddings from a dataset of 1.4 million images and utilize PyTorch Lightning for model training and Apache Spark for data management. Learn about our image processing techniques, including transforming images into grids of tiles and aggregating predictions to overcome computational challenges. Discover the significant performance improvements achieved and get insights into multi-label image classification. Perfect for PyTorch developers, this session will include a Q&amp;A and access to our complete codebase at <a href="https://github.com/dsgt-kaggle-clef/plantclef-2024">github.com/dsgt-kaggle-clef/plantclef-2024</a>.</p>
