# Installing on Linux
{:.no_toc}

PyTorch can be installed and used on various Linux distributions. Depending on your system and compute requirements, your experience with PyTorch on Linux may vary in terms of processing time. It is recommended, but not required, that your Linux system has an NVIDIA or AMD GPU in order to harness the full power of PyTorch's [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) [support](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html?highlight=cuda#cuda-tensors) or [ROCm](https://docs.amd.com) support.

## Prerequisites
{: #linux-prerequisites}

### Supported Linux Distributions

PyTorch is supported on Linux distributions that use [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) >= v2.17, which include the following:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/download/), minimum version 2012-07-15
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/), minimum version 7.3-1611
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/), minimum version 8.0
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), minimum version 24
* [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php), minimum version 14
* [OpenSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/), minimum version 42.1
* [PCLinuxOS](https://www.pclinuxos.com/), minimum version 2014.7
* [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/getslack/), minimum version 14.2
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), minimum version 13.04

> The install instructions here will generally apply to all supported Linux distributions. An example difference is that your distribution may support `yum` instead of `apt`. The specific examples shown were run on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine.

### Python
{: #linux-python}

Python 3.8-3.11 is generally installed by default on any of our supported Linux distributions, which meets our recommendation.

> Tip: By default, you will have to use the command `python3` to run Python. If you want to use just the command `python`, instead of `python3`, you can symlink `python` to the `python3` binary.

However, if you want to install another version, there are multiple ways:

* APT
* [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

If you decide to use APT, you can run the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo apt install python
```

> If you use [Anaconda](#anaconda) to install PyTorch, it will install a sandboxed version of Python that will be used for running PyTorch applications.

### Package Manager
{: #linux-package-manager}

To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use one of two supported package managers: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Anaconda is the recommended package manager as it will provide you all of the PyTorch dependencies in one, sandboxed install, including Python.

#### Anaconda

To install Anaconda, you will use the [command-line installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux). Right-click on the 64-bit installer link, select `Copy Link Location`, and then use the following commands:

```bash
# The version of Anaconda may be different depending on when you are installing`
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# and follow the prompts. The defaults are generally good.`
```

> You may have to open a new terminal or re-source your `~/.bashrc `to get access to the `conda` command.

#### pip

*Python 3*

While Python 3.x is installed by default on Linux, `pip` is not installed by default.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

> Tip: If you want to use just the command  `pip`, instead of `pip3`, you can symlink `pip` to the `pip3` binary.

## Installation
{: #linux-installation}

### Anaconda
{: #linux-anaconda}

#### No CUDA/ROCm

To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and do not have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) or [ROCm-capable](https://docs.amd.com) system or do not require CUDA/ROCm (i.e. GPU support), in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Conda, Language: Python and Compute Platform: CPU.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With CUDA

To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and you do have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Conda and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With ROCm

PyTorch via Anaconda is not supported on ROCm currently. Please use pip instead.


### pip
{: #linux-pip}

#### No CUDA

To install PyTorch via pip, and do not have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) or [ROCm-capable](https://docs.amd.com) system or do not require CUDA/ROCm (i.e. GPU support), in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and Compute Platform: CPU.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With CUDA

To install PyTorch via pip, and do have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With ROCm

To install PyTorch via pip, and do have a [ROCm-capable](https://docs.amd.com) system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and the ROCm version supported.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

## Verification
{: #linux-verification}

To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.


```python
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

The output should be something similar to:

```
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
```

Additionally, to check if your GPU driver and CUDA/ROCm is enabled and accessible by PyTorch, run the following commands to return whether or not the GPU driver is enabled (the ROCm build of PyTorch uses the same semantics at the python API level [link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/source/notes/hip.rst#hip-interfaces-reuse-the-cuda-interfaces), so the below commands should also work for ROCm):

```python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

## Building from source
{: #linux-from-source}

For the majority of PyTorch users, installing from a pre-built binary via a package manager will provide the best experience. However, there are times when you may want to install the bleeding edge PyTorch code, whether for testing or actual development on the PyTorch core. To install the latest PyTorch code, you will need to [build PyTorch from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source).

### Prerequisites
{: #linux-prerequisites-2}

1. Install [Anaconda](#anaconda) or [Pip](#pip)
2. If you need to build PyTorch with GPU support
   a. for NVIDIA GPUs, install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), if your machine has a [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
   b. for AMD GPUs, install [ROCm](https://docs.amd.com), if your machine has a [ROCm-enabled GPU](https://docs.amd.com)
3. Follow the steps described here: [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source)

You can verify the installation as described [above](#linux-verification).
