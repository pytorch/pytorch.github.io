# Installing on Windows
{:.no_toc}

PyTorch can be installed and used on various Windows distributions. Depending on your system and compute requirements, your experience with PyTorch on Windows may vary in terms of processing time. It is recommended, but not required, that your Windows system has an NVIDIA GPU in order to harness the full power of PyTorch's [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) [support](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html?highlight=cuda#cuda-tensors).

## Prerequisites
{: #windows-prerequisites}

### Supported Windows Distributions

PyTorch is supported on the following Windows distributions:

* [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) 7 and greater; [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) or greater recommended.
* [Windows Server 2008](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-server) r2 and greater

> The install instructions here will generally apply to all supported Windows distributions. The specific examples shown will be run on a Windows 10 Enterprise machine

### Python
{: #windows-python}

Currently, PyTorch on Windows only supports Python 3.8-3.11; Python 2.x is not supported.

As it is not installed by default on Windows, there are multiple ways to install Python:

* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
* [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
* [Anaconda](#anaconda)

> If you use Anaconda to install PyTorch, it will install a sandboxed version of Python that will be used for running PyTorch applications.

> If you decide to use Chocolatey, and haven't installed Chocolatey yet, ensure that you are running your command prompt as an administrator.

For a Chocolatey-based install, run the following command in an administrative command prompt:

```bash
choco install python
```

### Package Manager
{: #windows-package-manager}

To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use at least one of two supported package managers: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Anaconda is the recommended package manager as it will provide you all of the PyTorch dependencies in one, sandboxed install, including Python and `pip.`

#### Anaconda

To install Anaconda, you will use the [64-bit graphical installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows) for PyTorch 3.x. Click on the installer link and select `Run`. Anaconda will download and the installer prompt will be presented to you. The default options are generally sane.

#### pip

If you installed Python by any of the recommended ways [above](#windows-python), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) will have already been installed for you.

## Installation
{: #windows-installation}

### Anaconda
{: #windows-anaconda}

To install PyTorch with Anaconda, you will need to open an Anaconda prompt via `Start | Anaconda3 | Anaconda Prompt`.

#### No CUDA

To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and do not have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system or do not require CUDA, in the above selector, choose OS: Windows, Package: Conda and CUDA: None.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With CUDA

To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and you do have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system, in the above selector, choose OS: Windows, Package: Conda and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.


### pip
{: #windows-pip}

#### No CUDA

To install PyTorch via pip, and do not have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system or do not require CUDA, in the above selector, choose OS: Windows, Package: Pip and CUDA: None.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

#### With CUDA

To install PyTorch via pip, and do have a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system, in the above selector, choose OS: Windows, Package: Pip and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.


## Verification
{: #windows-verification}

To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.

From the command line, type:

```bash
python
```

then enter the following code:

```python
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

The output should be something similar to:

```
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
```

Additionally, to check if your GPU driver and CUDA is enabled and accessible by PyTorch, run the following commands to return whether or not the CUDA driver is enabled:

```python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

## Building from source
{: #windows-from-source}

For the majority of PyTorch users, installing from a pre-built binary via a package manager will provide the best experience. However, there are times when you may want to install the bleeding edge PyTorch code, whether for testing or actual development on the PyTorch core. To install the latest PyTorch code, you will need to [build PyTorch from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source).

### Prerequisites
{: #windows-prerequisites-2}

1. Install [Anaconda](#anaconda)
2. Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), if your machine has a [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
3. If you want to build on Windows, Visual Studio with MSVC toolset, and NVTX are also needed. The exact requirements of those dependencies could be found out [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source).
4. Follow the steps described here: [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source)

You can verify the installation as described [above](#windows-verification).
