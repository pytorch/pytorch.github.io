# Using PyTorch with Lightning Studios
{:.no_toc}

Lightning Studios let you fully experience PyTorch and its ecosystem on accelerated compute in seconds. You can pick a GPU and customize from your browser or any local IDE with zero setup.

**Lightning Studios provide:**

* ready-to-use environments that come with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning pre-installed
* accelerated computing on GPUs such as L4, L40S, and H100, and the ability to switch between them in seconds
* optimized multi-node training, to scale up PyTorch training jobs across machines

Lightning Studios enable you to share fully reproducible environments preloaded with everything you need to build AI systems, like data processing, pretraining, finetuning, inference, etc. Our library of 2K community-built, open sourced templates have pre-installed dependencies, model weights, data, code and more.

## Getting Started

## Build AI, not infrastructure
{: #ls-build}

With Lightning Studios, you can easily build AI products with full and low code tools in one place, plus access GPUs, train models and deploy.

AI products like Stable Diffusion and NVIDIA’s NeMo are built with Lightning. Whether you're experimenting with your first model, AI app, or deploying AI at enterprise scale. Lightning powers every stage — even pretraining LLMs on 10,000+ GPUs.
