torch.compile
====================

:func:`~torch.compile` was introduced in `PyTorch 2.0 <https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/>`__

Our default and supported backend is `inductor` with benchmarks `showing 30% to 2x speedups and 10% memory compression <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/93794>`__
on real world models for both training and inference with a single line of code.

.. note::
    The :func:`~torch.compile` API is experimental and subject to change.

The simplest possible interesting program is the below which we go over in a lot more detail in `getting started <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/compile/get-started.html>`__
showing how to use :func:`~torch.compile` to speed up inference on a variety of real world models from both TIMM and HuggingFace which we
co-announced `here <https://pytorch.org/blog/Accelerating-Hugging-Face-and-TIMM-models/>`__

.. code:: python

   import torch
   def fn(x):
       x = torch.cos(x).cuda()
       x = torch.sin(x).cuda()
       return x
   compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn(torch.randn(10).cuda()))

If you happen to be running your model on an Ampere GPU, it's crucial to enable tensor cores. We will actually warn you to set
``torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')``

:func:`~torch.compile` works over :class:`~torch.nn.Module` as well as functions so you can pass in your entire training loop.

The above example was for inference but you can follow this tutorial for an `example on training <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html>`__


Optimizations
-------------

Optimizations can be passed in :func:`~torch.compile` with either a backend mode parameter or as passes. To understand what are the available options you can run
``torch._inductor.list_options`` and ``torch._inductor.list_mode_options()``

The default backend is `inductor` which will likely be the most reliable and performant option for most users and library maintainers,
other backends are there for power users who don't mind more experimental community support.

There is some nuance involved in benchmarking ``torch.compile`` so we've provided a utility to make this simpler with :func:`~torch.utils.benchmark.utils.compile.bench_all`

You can get the full list of community backends by running :func:`~torch._dynamo.list_backends`

Troubleshooting and Gotchas
---------------------------

IF you experience issues with models failing to compile, running of out of memory, recompiling too often, not giving accurate results,
odds are you will find the right tool to solve your problem in our guides.

.. WARNING::
    A few features are still very much in development and not likely to work for most users. Please do not use these features
    in production code and if you're a library maintainer please do not expose these options to your users
    Dynamic shapes ``dynamic=true`` and max autotune ``mode="max-autotune"`` which can be passed in to :func:`~torch.compile`.
    Distributed training has some quirks which you can follow in the troubleshooting guide below. Model export is not ready yet.
