torch.compiler
==============

``torch.compiler`` is a namespace through which some of the internal compiler
methods are surfaced for user consumption. The main function and the feature in
this namespace is ``torch.compile``.

``torch.compile`` is a PyTorch function introduced in PyTorch 2.x that aims to
solve the problem of accurate graph capturing in PyTorch and ultimately enable
software engineers to run their PyTorch programs faster. ``torch.compile`` is
written in Python and it marks the transition of PyTorch from C++ to Python.

``torch.compile`` leverages the following underlying technologies:

* **TorchDynamo (torch._dynamo)** is an internal API that uses a CPython
  feature called the Frame Evaluation API to safely capture PyTorch graphs.
  Methods that are available externally for PyTorch users are surfaced
  through the ``torch.compiler`` namespace.

* **TorchInductor** is the default ``torch.compile`` deep learning compiler
  that generates fast code for multiple accelerators and backends. You
  need to use a backend compiler to make speedups through ``torch.compile``
  possible. For NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, it leverages OpenAI Triton as the key
  building block.

* **AOT Autograd** captures not only the user-level code, but also backpropagation,
  which results in capturing the backwards pass "ahead-of-time". This enables
  acceleration of both forwards and backwards pass using TorchInductor.

.. note:: In some cases, the terms ``torch.compile``, TorchDynamo, ``torch.compiler``
   might be used interchangeably in this documentation.

As mentioned above, to run your workflows faster, ``torch.compile`` through
TorchDynamo requires a backend that converts the captured graphs into a fast
machine code. Different backends can result in various optimization gains.
The default backend is called TorchInductor, also known as *inductor*,
TorchDynamo has a list of supported backends developed by our partners,
which can be see by running ``torch.compile.list_backends()`` each of which
with its optional dependencies.

Some of the most commonly used backends include:
