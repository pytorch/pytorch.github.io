# FXE0011:no-symbolic-function-for-call-function
This error occurs when the ONNX converter is unable to find a corresponding symbolic function
to convert a "call_function" node in the input graph to its equivalence in ONNX. The "call_function"
node represents a normalized function call in PyTorch, such as "torch.aten.ops.add".

To resolve this error, you can try one of the following:

- If exists, apply the auto-fix suggested by the diagnostic. TODO: this part is not available yet.
- Rewrite the model using only supported PyTorch operators or functions.
- Follow this [guide](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#onnx-script-functions) to write and
  register a custom symbolic function for the unsupported call_function FX node.

TODO: Replace above link once docs for `dynamo_export` custom op registration are available.
