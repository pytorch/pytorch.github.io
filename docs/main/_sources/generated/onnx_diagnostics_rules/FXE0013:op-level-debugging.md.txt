# FXE0013:op-level-debugging
This warning message indicates that during op level debugging, certain symbolic functions
have failed to match the results of torch ops when using real tensors generated from fake
tensors. It is important to note that the symbolic functions may not necessarily be
incorrect, as the validation process is non-deterministic and should only be used as a
reference.

There are two categories of warnings that can be triggered:

1. Non-validated operators:
  If the warnings are caused by the following errors, they can be disregarded by users,
  as these errors occur due to the non-deterministic nature of the validation. However,
  it is important to be aware that the operators have not been validated.

  - IndexError: Unsupported input arguments of randomized dimensions/indices(INT64).
  - RuntimeError: Unsupported input arguments for torch ops are generated.
  - ValueError: Arguments/keyword arguments do not match the signature of the symbolic function.

2. Potentially wrong torchlib operators:
  If the warnings are triggered by the following error, users should be aware that
  the results from symbolic functions do not match the results of torch ops, suggesting
  that the symbolic functions may be incorrect in dispatching or implementation. In such cases,
  it is recommended to report the issue to the PyTorch-ONNX team, or create/register a custom
  symbolic function to replace the default one.

  - AssertionError: The symbolic function is potentially wrong.
