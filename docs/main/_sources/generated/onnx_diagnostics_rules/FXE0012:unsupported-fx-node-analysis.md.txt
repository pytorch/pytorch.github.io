# FXE0012:unsupported-fx-node-analysis
This error indicates that an FX graph contains one or more unsupported nodes. The error message
is typically accompanied by a list of the unsupported nodes found during analysis.

To resolve this error, you can try resolving each individual unsupported node error by following
the suggestions by its diagnostic. Typically, options include:

- If exists, apply the auto-fix suggested by the diagnostic. TODO: this part is not available yet.
- Rewrite the model using only supported PyTorch operators or functions.
- Follow this [guide](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#onnx-script-functions) to write and
  register a custom symbolic function for the unsupported call_function FX node.
