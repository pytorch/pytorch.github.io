Train script
-------------

If your train script works with ``torch.distributed.launch`` it will continue
working with ``torchrun`` with these differences:

1. No need to manually pass ``RANK``, ``WORLD_SIZE``,
   ``MASTER_ADDR``, and ``MASTER_PORT``.

2. ``rdzv_backend`` and ``rdzv_endpoint`` can be provided. For most users
   this will be set to ``c10d`` (see `rendezvous <rendezvous.html>`_). The default
   ``rdzv_backend`` creates a non-elastic rendezvous where ``rdzv_endpoint`` holds
   the master address.

3. Make sure you have a ``load_checkpoint(path)`` and
   ``save_checkpoint(path)`` logic in your script. When any number of
   workers fail we restart all the workers with the same program
   arguments so you will lose progress up to the most recent checkpoint
   (see `elastic launch <run.html>`_).

4. ``use_env`` flag has been removed. If you were parsing local rank by parsing
   the ``--local_rank`` option, you need to get the local rank from the
   environment variable ``LOCAL_RANK`` (e.g. ``int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])``).

Below is an expository example of a training script that checkpoints on each
epoch, hence the worst-case progress lost on failure is one full epoch worth
of training.

.. code-block:: python

  def main():
       args = parse_args(sys.argv[1:])
       state = load_checkpoint(args.checkpoint_path)
       initialize(state)

       # torch.distributed.run ensures that this will work
       # by exporting all the env vars needed to initialize the process group
       torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend=args.backend)

       for i in range(state.epoch, state.total_num_epochs)
            for batch in iter(state.dataset)
                train(batch, state.model)

            state.epoch += 1
            save_checkpoint(state)
