# FXE0007:fx-graph-to-onnx
This diagnostic tracks the transformation process from an FX Graph (in FX IR) to an ONNX Graph (in ONNX IR).

## Key Representations:

- **FX Graph**: The graph in FX IR produced by dynamo or symbolic tracing.
- **ONNX Graph**: The graph in ONNX IR and [operators](https://onnx.ai/onnx/operators/).

## Additional Notes:

- Prior to this transformation step, the FX graph undergoes preprocessing through multiple FX passes.
  To gain insight into these transformations, refer to diagnostic `FXE0010`.
- To enable a detailed view of the graph transformation in progress within this diagnostic, switch to the DEBUG mode.

  - Set DiagnosticOptions.verbosity_level to logging.DEBUG.
  - Activate the environment variable TORCH_LOGS='onnx_diagnostics'.

- For specific information related to node-level FX to ONNX transformations, explore the diagnostic `FXE0008`.
