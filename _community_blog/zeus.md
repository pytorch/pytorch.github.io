[Zeus](https://github.com/ml-energy/zeus) is an open-source toolbox for measuring and optimizing the energy consumption of deep learning workloads. Our goal is to make energy optimization based on accurate measurements as easy as possible for diverse deep learning workloads and setups by offering composable tools with minimal assumptions.
