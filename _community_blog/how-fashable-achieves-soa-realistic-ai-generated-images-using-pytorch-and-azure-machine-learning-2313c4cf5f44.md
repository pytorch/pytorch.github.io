Fashable is a company born at XNFY Lab (a joint initiative with Microsoft). The company’s main goal is to revolutionize the world of fashion with ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies built on PyTorch framework. Fashable is focused on developing AI models that generates synthetic contents for the global fashion industry. The Fashion industry has been criticized in recent years because it generates a lot of waste and is responsible for up to 10% of global carbon dioxide output. Fashable has stepped up to address this issue by introducing multiple AI solutions that generates realistic personalized consumer garments without actually producing them to help in reducing carbon footprint. This will help the fashion brands make informed decisions without investing in experimental products and also reducing the industry’s carbon footprint globally. Hence, in Fashable, our IP models utilize modern approaches, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), best seller analysis, custom dataset creation, and so on to resolve such problems.
