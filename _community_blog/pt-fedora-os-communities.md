At [DevConf.IN 2025](https://www.devconf.info/in/) in Pune, I had the opportunity to host a **[PyTorch Meetup](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2025/talk/W3YURM/)** on February 28th. The session, titled "**Powering AI with PyTorch, Fedora, and Open Source Communities**" was aimed at introducing PyTorch to students and professionals, explaining why **PyTorch+Fedora** form an ideal AI development platform. The other key aspect I covered was collaboration between open source communities.
