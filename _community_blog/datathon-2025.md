**We’re excited to have PyTorch sponsor [Datathon 2025: DataOrbit](https://dataorbit-2025.devpost.com/)**, a place where students can collaborate with a team to solve problems using real-world datasets! This event, hosted by Data Science UCSB in collaboration with Gaucho Sports Analytics and ACM@UCSB, will take place on **February 22–23rd, 2025 at UC Santa Barbara**, with the incredible opportunity to present your project to a panel of corporate and faculty judges – **including the executive director of Pytorch!** – for a chance to win prizes up to $3000.
