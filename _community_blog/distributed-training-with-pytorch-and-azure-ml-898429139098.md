Suppose you have a very large PyTorch model, and you’ve already tried many common tricks to speed up training: you optimized your code, you moved training to the cloud and selected a fast GPU VM, you installed software packages that improve training performance (for example, by using the ACPT curated environment on Azure ML). And yet, you still wish your model could train faster. Maybe it’s time to give distributed training a try! Continue reading to learn the simplest way to do distributed training with PyTorch and Azure ML.
