        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2" id="why-executorch">Why ExecuTorch?</h2>
        
        <p>Supporting on-device AI presents unique challenges with diverse hardware, critical power requirements, low/no internet connectivity, and realtime processing needs. These constraints have historically prevented or slowed down the creation of scalable and performant on-device AI solutions. We designed ExecuTorch, backed by our industry leaders like Meta, Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm, to be highly portable and provide superior developer productivity without losing on performance.</p>
