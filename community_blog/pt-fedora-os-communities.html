<p>At <a href="https://www.devconf.info/in/">DevConf.IN 2025</a> in Pune, I had the opportunity to host a <strong><a href="https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2025/talk/W3YURM/">PyTorch Meetup</a></strong> on February 28th. The session, titled “<strong>Powering AI with PyTorch, Fedora, and Open Source Communities</strong>” was aimed at introducing PyTorch to students and professionals, explaining why <strong>PyTorch+Fedora</strong> form an ideal AI development platform. The other key aspect I covered was collaboration between open source communities.</p>
