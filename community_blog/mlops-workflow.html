<p>PyTorch is one of the most widely used and most powerful deep learning frameworks for training and deploying complex neural networks. It has never been easier to train and deploy AI applications, and low-cost, high-performance, energy-efficient hardware, tools, and technology for creating optimized workflows are more accessible than ever.  But data science, machine learning, and devops can be deep topics unto themselves, and it can be overwhelming for developers with one specialty to see how they all come together in the real world, or even to know where to get started.</p>
