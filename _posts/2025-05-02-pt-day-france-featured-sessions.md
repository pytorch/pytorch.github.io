title: 'PyTorch Day France Featured Sessions: A Defining Moment for Open Source AI'
---

[PyTorch Day France](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/pytorch-day-france/) offers a front-row seat to the future of open source AI. Taking place **7 May at Station F in Paris** and co-located with **[GOSIM AI Paris](https://paris2025.gosim.org/)**, this one-day event will bring together developers, researchers, and industry leaders for a day of technical sessions, real-world insights, and community exchange.


### üåçA Major Milestone for the PyTorch Foundation

This event marks the very first **PyTorch Day**, launching a new international series hosted annually in different regions to convene AI researchers, developers, engineers, and enthusiasts. PyTorch Days are designed to spotlight open source AI advancements, foster community collaboration, and provide a forum to learn about active, high-impact AI projects built using PyTorch.

PyTorch Day France also represents a pivotal moment in the PyTorch Foundation‚Äôs journey. With its recent [expansion into an umbrella foundation]( https://pytorch.org/blog/pt-foundation-expands/), PyTorch is now positioned to support a broader ecosystem of trusted, community-driven AI projects across the full AI lifecycle.

At PyTorch Day France, you‚Äôll hear directly from PyTorch Foundation **Executive Director, Matt White,** about this transition‚Äîand get a first look at some exciting announcements.
