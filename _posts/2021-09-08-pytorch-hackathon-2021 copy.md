We’re excited to announce the PyTorch Annual Hackathon 2021! This year, we’re looking to support the community in creating innovative PyTorch tools, libraries, and applications. 2021 is the third year we’re hosting this Hackathon, and we welcome you to join the PyTorch community and put your machine learning skills into action. Submissions start on September 8 and end on November 3. Good luck to everyone!

## Submission Categories
You can enter your PyTorch projects into three categories:

* **PyTorch Responsible AI Development Tools & Libraries** - Build an AI development tool or library that helps develop AI models and applications responsibly. These tools, libraries, and apps need to support a researcher or developer to factor in fairness, security, and privacy throughout the entire machine learning development process of data gathering, model training, model validation, inferences, monitoring, and more. 

* **Web and Mobile Applications Powered by PyTorch** - Build an application with the web, mobile interface, and/or embedded device powered by PyTorch so the end users can interact with it. The submission must be built on PyTorch or use PyTorch-based libraries such as torchvision, torchtext, and fast.ai.

* **PyTorch Developer Tools & Libraries** - Build a creative, useful, and well-implemented tool or library for improving the productivity and efficiency of PyTorch researchers and developers. The submission must be a machine learning algorithm, model, or application built using PyTorch or PyTorch-based libraries.

## Prizes
Submissions will be judged on the idea’s quality, originality, implementation, and potential impact.

* **First-Place Winners** in each category of the Hackathon will receive $5,000 in cash, along with a 30-minute call with the PyTorch development team. 

* **Second-Place Winners** will receive $3,000.


* **Third-Place Winners** will receive $2,000.

All winners will also receive the opportunity to create blog posts that will be featured throughout PyTorch channels as well as an exclusive Github badge. Honorable Mentions will also be awarded to the following three highest-scoring entries in each category and will receive $1,000 each.

## Cloud Computing Credits
Request $100 in credits from Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud for your computing costs. Please allow 3 business days for your request to be reviewed. Credits will be provided to verified registrants until the supplies run out. For more information, see https://pytorch2021.devpost.com/details/sponsors. 

## 2020 Winning Projects

[DeMask](https://devpost.com/software/asteroid-the-pytorch-based-source-separation-toolkit) won first place in the PyTorch Developer Tools category. Built using Asteroid, a PyTorch-based audio source separation toolkit, DeMask is an end-to-end model for enhancing speech while wearing face masks.

[Q&Aid](https://devpost.com/software/pytorchxai) won first place in the Web/Mobile Applications Powered by PyTorch category. Backed by PyTorch core algorithms and models, Q&Aid is a conceptual health care chatbot aimed at making health care diagnoses and facilitating communication between patients and doctors.

[FairTorch](https://devpost.com/software/a-qeysp1) won first place in the PyTorch Responsible AI Development Tools category. FairTorch is a PyTorch fairness library that lets developers add constraints to their models to equalize metrics across subgroups by simply adding a few lines of code.
