title: "Ready, Set, Contribute: PyTorch Docathon Kickoff H1 2024"
---

The PyTorch Docathon is now live! This event is dedicated to enhancing the quality of the PyTorch documentation with the invaluable assistance of our community. Our hope with this Docathon is to simplify the process for new users to get started with PyTorch, guide them in effectively utilizing its features, and ultimately expedite the transition from research to production in machine learning.

4. To help prevent spam we are asking that you change your server username to your GitHub username or the email username you registered with.

## Explore the GitHub Issues

All the Docathon issues are posted on GitHub. You can find them by the docathon-h1-2024 label in the following participating repositories:

* [pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adocathon-h1-2024) 
* [pytorch/tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adocathon-h1-2024)
* [pytorch/xla](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22docathon-h1-2024%22)
* [pytorch-labs/torchfix](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchfix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adocathon-h1-2024)

The issues are categorized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and advanced. If this is your first time contributing to PyTorch, we recommend starting with an issue at the easy level. 

## Prizes for Winners

We will have a leaderboard throughout the duration of the Docathon. The more you contribute, the higher you’ll get on the board! Our top three winners will get free admission to [PyTorch Conference 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/pytorch-conference/).

## Thank you to our Partners

This year, we’re thrilled to work with the PyTorch Teams at Meta, Google and Snowflake to help us put on a successful event. We’ll also be at [Snowflake Dev Day](https://u20934166.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.I0np5LuiPyKW16wNY408Oo-2Bbsl8LTTFpumobGm2Rp-2F8zbPScG1hdhIF5oBHMWg96q8d7q31-2B1wRrzDpeTgLDCD6FBreEsZKA-2Fi2T-2BA2upbvMD1hmAnpEutE9KOQuxVZnSlQQ1xyyTXB16qRa8VpgLD4ScqnpqqdSffoL4rKHjpyoVMVMoxCsEuKcHJfDWGiMECgZDoegcf9j7bnJPdx0qXN4phU37F77vSXetvmrfy1t6YtpSvgX2eACaznmpmFNfyRtlDRsfdY8YgoZN3rkCMoL0bwCFXdt-2FvIZawhnUV2qppyS0ZgmSCGl-2BufBL0mn8HJIew4LxuXuUB3gfsWD1K6Hb2oiECdgEL-2BK-2BZ6OVUBbdfsupYb6tlGTA2Ic6jTTOODdc5-2B1RKMxIBw1-2FcC8Dzd4uxjdIqgrF4vQ0zdGsVXr2rsWISdAzRwwZ6HxvPYiL8vq_eKG3f-2BVkGDs-2F-2BQAgHZwkvtAslantAPMulCPu-2FMezvzmhqnecR6Zi4bBfzHqa-2BAIYrvYiOg1COidzFz394ty6L-2FhCaPa85b-2BvNqP8-2BnHbrX2cxmOcMxJolrQzGKT9AZVkURRXc3AUORnPJRfwJ32v8Dp-2Fpx9b2Kf973NO10Vsxu9GvjAtGFxlGl-2Bgjhs0tu8Jlhj-2BCG2lXGsFGXnxI1t1hw-3D-3D) on June 6 where you can hear from Meta’s Matthias Reso, and check out our PyTorch booth.
