Quantization is a method for improving model inference speeds by compressing model weights and performing (faster) computation in lower precision data types. However, quantization can result in accuracy loss due to the presence of outliers. Recent works like [QuaRot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456), [SpinQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406), and [FlashAttention-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08608) introduce methods to increase the numerical accuracy of INT4, INT8 and FP8 quantization in LLMs. These methods rely on [Hadamard Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform). In this blog, we present HadaCore, a Hadamard Transform CUDA kernel that achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs. Our kernel achieves speedups of **1.1–1.4x** and **1.0–1.3x**, with a peak gain of **3.5x** and **3.6x** respectively, over Dao AI Lab’s [Fast Hadamard Transform Kernel](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/fast-hadamard-transform). We leverage a hardware-aware work decomposition that benefits from Tensor Core acceleration while maintaining quantization error reduction.

The [HadaCore Kernel is publicly available](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/applied-ai/tree/main/kernels/cuda/inference/hadamard_transform).

**Background**

[QuaRot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456) and [SpinQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406) both propose methods to increase the numerical accuracy of INT4 and INT8 quantization in LLMs. Both methods rotate model activations since rotations are statistically likely to reduce the magnitude of outliers, as it “distributes” extreme values among other (less extreme) dimensions, and rotation is also an easily invertible operation using the inverse of the rotation matrix. These methods can also improve FP8 inference accuracy, such as in [FlashAttention-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08608).

Applying these rotation matrices introduces model runtime overhead due to the online operations shown in Figure 2. These rotations can be applied through matrix multiplication, but the added overhead would diminish the benefits from quantization. Therefore, QuaRot and SpinQuant opt to use Walsh-Hadamard matrices, a special type of rotation matrix that can be applied faster than matrix multiplication using the [Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Walsh%E2%80%93Hadamard_transform) algorithm. HadaCore is an optimized implementation of this algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs that support Tensor Cores.

**Tensor Core Accelerated Hadamard Transform**

HadaCore leverages [NVIDIA Tensor Cores](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/), which are specialized compute units on NVIDIA GPUs optimized for matrix multiplication. To achieve this, our kernel performs a hardware-aware work decomposition of the Fast Walsh-Hadamard algorithm. This work decomposition ensures that we can utilize the [MMA PTX instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html?highlight=mma#multiply-and-accumulate-instruction-mma) that execute on the Tensor Core chip. HadaCore applies a 16×16 Hadamard transform to chunks of the input data. The computation can then be offloaded to the FP16 Tensor Core with usage of the [mma.m16n8k16](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html?highlight=mma#matrix-fragments-for-mma-m16n8k16-with-floating-point-type) instruction. The warp-level parallelism for HadaCore is shown below.

*Figure 3: HadaCore Parallelization, 1x256 vectors (rows) being rotated by a size 256 Hadamard.*

We process fragments of 256 elements in parallel using warp-level Tensor Core operations to achieve up to a 256-size Hadamard transform. For further sizes, we shuffle data between warps and repeat.

**Microbenchmarks**

We benchmark HadaCore against the[ Dao AI Lab Hadamard Kernel](https://github.com/Dao-AILab) on both NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs across varying Hadamard and input tensor sizes.

We showcase our speedup as the input tensor size (labeled element count) in our charts increase. Element count is the number of elements in the target matrix we are rotating. For example, in multi-head attention: \


The queries (Q), keys (K) and values (V) tensors are 4D tensors of size: 

 \
                                 `(batch_size, seq_len, n_heads, head_dim)` \
 \
A Hadamard matrix of size `head_dim` is applied to these activation tensors, so we refer to this as using a Hadamard size of `head_dim` with an element count of:

                                 `batch_size*seq_len*n_heads*head_dim`.

Common element counts for query rotations in an attention block:

HadaCore achieves **1.1–1.4x** speedup on A100 and **1.0–1.3x** speedup on H100 over Dao AI Lab’s Fast Hadamard kernel, with a peak gain of **3.5x and 3.6x, **respectively. For smaller sizes on H100, HadaCore’s gain decreases. For future work, we plan to incorporate usage of Hopper specific features like TMA and WGMMA for improved H100 performance.

**MMLU Benchmarks**

We evaluated MMLU scores on a [Llama 3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B) inference workload where the FlashAttention computation was performed in FP8. Newer generation [NVIDIA Hopper GPUs ](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/)come equipped with FP8 Tensor Cores that deliver substantial compute gain over FP16.  \
Our results show the benefit of using HadaCore for accuracy preservation when combined with optimizations such as FP8 FlashAttention.

*Table 1: MMLU scores for Llama3.1 8B with FP16 baseline and FP8 attention using Hadamard transforms, comparing an implementation with explicit Hadamard matrix multiplications vs. HadaCore (**higher is better**)*

From the above MMLU scores, we note that for Llama3.1-8B inference with FP8 attention, HadaCore improves the quantization error introduced from computing attention in a lower precision.

**Conclusion**

We showcased our speedups achieved by moving the Fast-Walsh Hadamard algorithm into a CUDA kernel that leverages Tensor Core acceleration and achieves a peak speedup of **3.5x** and **3.6x **over the Dao AI Fast-Hadamard kernel on NVIDIA A100 and H100, respectively.  \
Further, we showed on the MMLU benchmark that rotating with HadaCore maintains similar quantization error reduction to the Fast-Hadamard kernel, while providing computational acceleration.

**Future Work**

We plan to implement a Triton version of our kernel and experiment with more advanced techniques such as kernel fusion to support fused Hadamard transform and quantization. Further, we plan to extend our kernel to support BF16 Tensor Core compute.
