title: "Announcing PyTorch Docathon H2 2023"
---

We are excited to announce that we will be holding a Docathon for PyTorch on November 1, 2023! This event is an opportunity for our community to come together and improve the quality of our documentation.

During the Docathon, we will focus on updating and improving existing content, as well as adding new tutorials and docstrings. We encourage all members of the community to participate and contribute their expertise to make our documentation even better. This is a great opportunity to learn and collaborate together.

Check out our previous docathon success story [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/docathon-h1-2023-wrap-up/).


## Why Participate

One of the best things about the Docathon is that you can make a tangible, positive impact on the quality of documentation in real time. This collaborative event brings together diverse team members from various companies, backgrounds, and roles, united to work towards a common goal. This event not only fosters team building and knowledge sharing but also presents an opportunity for individuals to acquire new skills, such as writing, editing, and utilizing documentation tools. Participating in a docathon can be particularly beneficial for team members who may lack experience in these areas.

And of course all participants will be recognized for their contributions. Top participants will receive special awards.
