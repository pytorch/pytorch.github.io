The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that Graphcore has joined as a general member.

Graphcore is a UK-based company that specializes in designing and manufacturing AI accelerators, hardware and software specifically tailored for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads.

“We’re thrilled that PyTorch is the leading framework for development on the Graphcore  platform,” said Executive Director of the PyTorch Foundation Ibrahim Haddad. “Graphcore has played  an important role in the hardware and open source space, and we look forward to their continued contributions to PyTorch.”

Graphcore has contributed to the PyTorch ecosystem by developing integrations to run on their IPU hardware. These integrations enable researchers and practitioners to use their preferred frameworks while taking advantage of Graphcore's specialized hardware.

“At Graphcore we’re truly aligned with PyTorch’s objective of reducing the barrier of entry to AI practitioners. By supporting a native PyTorch software environment for IPUs we are giving developers access to new underlying hardware, designed from the ground up for AI, to help unlock new AI techniques to improve efficiency or performance and to drive breakthroughs in AI research and applications, with the same user-friendly PyTorch framework they know and expect. We look forward to contributing to and growing the global AI community as an active member of the PyTorch Foundation and are proud to be the first general member.” Anthony Barbier, Software Frameworks Lead at Graphcore.
