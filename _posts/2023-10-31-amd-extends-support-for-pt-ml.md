title: "AMD Extends Support for PyTorch Machine Learning Development on Select RDNA™ 3 GPUs with ROCm™ 5.7"
author: AMD
---

Researchers and developers working with Machine Learning (ML) models and algorithms using PyTorch can now use AMD ROCm 5.7 on Ubuntu® Linux® to tap into the parallel computing power of the Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon™ PRO W7900 graphics cards which are based on the AMD RDNA™ 3 GPU architecture.

A client solution built on these two high-end GPUs enables a local, private, and cost-effective workflow for ML training and inference for those who previously relied on cloud-based solutions alone.

## Accelerate Machine Learning With Pytorch On Your Desktop



* A local PC or workstation system running PyTorch with a Radeon 7900 series GPU presents a capable, yet affordable solution to address these growing workflow challenges thanks to large GPU memory sizes of 24GB and even 48GB.

## Unified Software Stack For The Desktop And The Datacenter



* The latest AMD ROCm 5.7 software stack for GPU programming unlocks the massively parallel compute power of these RDNA™ 3 architecture-based GPUs for use with PyTorch, one of the leading ML frameworks. The same unified software stack also supports the CDNA™ GPU architecture of the AMD Instinct™ MI series accelerators.

## Freedom To Customize

* The AMD ROCm platform is primarily Open-Source Software (OSS).  It allows developers the freedom to customize and tailor their GPU software for their own needs while collaborating with a community of other developers, and helping each other find solutions in an agile, flexible, and rapid manner. The AMD ROCm platform’s goal is to allow users to maximize their GPU hardware investment. The AMD ROCm platform is designed to help develop, test, and deploy GPU accelerated HPC, AI, scientific computing, CAD, and other applications in a free, open source, integrated and secure software ecosystem.

As the industry moves towards an ecosystem that supports a broad set of systems, frameworks and accelerators, AMD is determined to continue to make AI more accessible to PyTorch developers and researchers that benefit from a local client-based setup for ML development using RDNA™ 3 architecture-based desktop GPUs.
