New this year, the Startup Showcase was an exciting addition to the PyTorch Conference. Featuring early-stage founders pitching their AI startups to a panel of top venture capitalists, this event showcased the next generation of AI-driven innovation. The finalists for the inaugural PyTorch Conference Startup Showcase included Remix Inc., Cartesia, OpenBabylon, Remyx AI, A2 Labs, Inc., QuicSnap, Iso AI, CTGT, and Creao.ai, representing some of the most innovative AI/ML startups in the industry. Attendees got a front-row seat to see cutting-edge AI startups in action, while top VCs from the AI industry evaluated the pitches.

Congratulations to the PyTorch Conference Startup Showcase winner, CTGT!  Deep learning can be opaque and biased, which limits its potential in crucial areas like healthcare and finance. CTGT is changing the game by enhancing data lineage in LLMs and cutting hallucinations. They're empowering companies to create customized models using 500x less compute.
