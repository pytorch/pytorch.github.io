The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that Intel has joined as a premier member.

“The PyTorch Foundation is thrilled to welcome Intel as a premier member, marking a significant milestone in our mission to empower the global AI community. Intel's extensive expertise and commitment to advancing cutting-edge technologies align perfectly with our vision of fostering open-source innovation,” said PyTorch Foundation Executive Director Ibrahim Haddad. “Together, we will accelerate the development and democratization of PyTorch, and use the collaboration to shape a vibrant future of AI for all.”

Intel has developed and released several PyTorch-based tools and libraries to enable developers to accelerate their AI workflows, and is actively working on optimizing PyTorch to leverage Intel hardware capabilities.

“At Intel, we believe in the power of collaboration and open-source innovation to propel the ecosystem towards an AI Everywhere future. Joining the Governing Board of the PyTorch Foundation is a testament to Intel’s commitment to advancing and democratizing AI,” said Wei Li, Vice President and General Manager of Artificial Intelligence and Analytics (AIA) at Intel. “By harnessing the collective expertise and resources within the deep learning community, we aim to accelerate the development of PyTorch and continue to drive breakthroughs in AI research and applications.”

Intel fosters industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open source contributions to accelerate software innovation and develop new technologies that bring benefits to the open source community. By working together with other member companies and under the guidance of the PyTorch Foundation, Intel remains committed to actively contributing to and advocating for the community.

As a premier member, Intel is granted one seat to the PyTorch Foundation Governing Board. The Board sets policy through our bylaws, mission and vision statements, describing the overarching scope of foundation initiatives, technical vision, and direction.
