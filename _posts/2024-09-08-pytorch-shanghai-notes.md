Jiawei Li, a PyTorch collaborator from Huawei, introduced PyTorch's Dispatch mechanism and emphasized the limitations of DIspatchKey. He took Huawei Ascend NPU as an example to share the best practices of the PyTorch PrivateUse1 mechanism. He mentioned that while using the PrivateUse1 mechanism, Huawei also submitted many improvements and bug fixes for the mechanism to the PyTorch community. He also mentioned that due to the lack of upstream CI support for out-of-tree devices, changes in upstream code may affect their stability and quality, and this insight was recognized by everyone.
