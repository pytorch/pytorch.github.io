The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that Rebellions has joined as a general member.

Rebellions is a South Korea-based semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of AI chips for data centers and edge devices. Their innovative hardware and software solutions aim to accelerate generative AI and machine learning workloads, focusing on high energy efficiency and performance. The company successfully launched and deployed its AI chip ‘ATOM’ targeting data centers in 2023 and is developing its next-generation AI accelerator ‘REBEL’.

"We’re thrilled to welcome Rebellions as a new general member of the PyTorch Foundation,” said Matt White, Executive Director of the PyTorch Foundation. “Rebellions brings a unique perspective to the PyTorch ecosystem with their focus on advancing the integration of NPU architectures for AI acceleration with PyTorch. Their expertise will play a vital role in ensuring PyTorch continues to evolve as a versatile framework, accommodating the diverse needs of modern AI workloads. We look forward to collaborating with Rebellions to drive innovation and strengthen the PyTorch ecosystem for developers worldwide.”

Rebellions has introduced native support for PyTorch 2.0 in their RBLN SDK. This integration includes compatibility with torch.compile, a pivotal feature of PyTorch 2.0 that enhances model performance. Through this development, Rebellions has empowered developers to seamlessly harness the full potential of their AI accelerator lineup within the environment.

Rebellions is also deeply committed to advancing the PyTorch ecosystem through collaborative innovation starting in Korea. The company has established a Special Interest Group (SIG) focusing on Pytorch Core within the PyTorch Korea community and is actively working with volunteers recruited through MODULABS, an open research institute, to integrate native support for the deep learning framework into their Neural Processing Unit (NPU).

In addition, Rebellions is collaborating with academic institutions, such as Yonsei University, Hanyang University, University of Science & Technology (UST)  and national agencies, such as the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), to offer undergraduate and graduate courses on PyTorch and enable them to leverage Pytorch as their research platform.

These initiatives highlight Rebellions' dedication to optimizing the PyTorch experience for developers and researchers alike, while also fostering education and innovation in the field.

“By integrating our hardware innovations with PyTorch, we’re building Native NPU support to accelerate diverse AI workloads.” said Hong-seok Kim, the Chief Software Architect at Rebellions. “We're excited to contribute to the PyTorch community by community-driven initiatives and partnerships, advancing NPU architecture support for next-generation AI solutions. Together with the PyTorch community, we aim to pioneer new possibilities in AI acceleration and empower developers worldwide with efficient computing solutions.”
