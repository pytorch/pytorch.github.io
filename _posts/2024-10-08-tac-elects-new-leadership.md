Luca Antiga is the CTO at Lightning AI since 2022. He is an early contributor to PyTorch core and co-authored “Deep Learning with PyTorch” (published by Manning). He started his journey as a researcher in Bioengineering, and later co-founded Orobix, a company focused on building and deploying AI in production settings.

“I am looking forward to taking on the role of the chair of the PyTorch TAC,” says Luca. “As the TAC chair, I will ensure effective, timely topic selection and enhance visibility of technical needs from the board members and from the ecosystem at large. I will strive for directional, cohesive messaging throughout the transition of PyTorch from Meta to the Linux Foundation.”

Jiong Gong is a Principal Engineer and SW Architect for PyTorch Optimization from Intel. He serves as one of the PyTorch CPU module maintainers and is an active contributor to the TorchInductor CPU backend.



“I plan to further strengthen the collaboration between PyTorch developers and hardware vendors, promoting innovation and performance optimization across various hardware platforms, enhancing PyTorch ecosystem and streamlining the decision-making process,” says Jiong. “I am honored to serve as the vice chair of the TAC.”

 

## What Does the TAC Do?

The PyTorch Foundation's TAC provides a forum for technical communication, leadership,  and collaboration for the PyTorch Foundation. The committee members are members of the PyTorch Foundation.  The committee holds open meetings once a month that anyone in the community can attend.  The committee provides thought leadership on technical topics, knowledge sharing, and a forum to discuss issues with other technical experts in the community.
