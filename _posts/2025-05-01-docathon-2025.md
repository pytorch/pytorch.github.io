title: 'Announcing the PyTorch Docathon 2025'
---

We're thrilled to announce the [2025 PyTorch Docathon](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/events/details/lfhq-pytorch-foundation-presents-pytorch-docathon-june-3rd-18th-2025/)! This is a hackathon-style event aimed at enhancing PyTorch documentation with the support of the community. Documentation is a vital component of any technology, and by refining it, we can simplify the onboarding process for new users, help them effectively utilize PyTorch's features, and ultimately speed up the transition from research to production in machine learning.


## WHY PARTICIPATE


### Low Barrier to Entry

Unlike many open-source projects that require deep knowledge of the codebase and previous contributions to join hackathon events, the Docathon is tailored for newcomers. While we expect participants to be familiar with Python, and have basic knowledge of PyTorch and machine learning, there are tasks related to website issues that don't even require that level of expertise.


### Tangible Results

A major advantage of the Docathon is witnessing the immediate impact of your contributions. Enhancing documentation significantly boosts a project's usability and accessibility, and you'll be able to observe these improvements directly. Seeing tangible outcomes can also be a strong motivator to continue contributing.


### Collaborative Environment

The Docathon fosters a collaborative atmosphere, offering you the chance to work alongside other contributors and PyTorch maintainers to improve the documentation. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn from peers, exchange ideas, and build connections.


### Learning Opportunities

Even if you're not a PyTorch expert, the Docathon offers a valuable learning experience. You'll have the chance to delve into PyTorch modules, test tutorials on your machine, and explore them in the CI environment.


## WHO SHOULD PARTICIPATE

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned documentation expert or just starting out, we invite everyone to join in the PyTorch docathon to contribute and develop your skills and knowledge to help improve the documentation for everyone! We will have issues labelled by skill level, and the PyTorch Discord will be available for collaboration and help.
