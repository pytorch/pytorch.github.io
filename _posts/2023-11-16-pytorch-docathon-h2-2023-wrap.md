We are thrilled to announce the successful completion of the Fall 2023 PyTorch Docathon! The event was a resounding success, and we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants who made it possible. Dedication, expertise, and tireless efforts of our open-source contributors have once again helped us to improve PyTorch documentation.

This Docathon ran from Nov 1 through Nov 15 with more than 170 registrants. The energy and enthusiasm were palpable, and entrants were judged on the difficulty of submissions that resulted in over TBA merged pull requests. We have fixed the PyTorch docstrings and made them compatible with the PEP 257 Python Docstring Conventions guidelines. We also have fixed multiple bugs in the pytorch/tutorials repo.

We want to give a special shout-out to our top contributors, who went above and beyond during this event. Your dedication and expertise have been invaluable in enhancing the PyTorch documentation and empowering developers worldwide.
