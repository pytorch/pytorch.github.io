author: Eli Uriegas, Meta and Jennifer Bly, PyTorch Foundation
---

This past year was a monumental year for PyTorch from major releases to the flagship PyTorch Conference. We’ve seen incredible growth in contributions from more than 3,500 individuals and 3,000 organizations. It’s safe to say PyTorch has now become the dominant deep learning framework for AI/ML.  PyTorch leads the model training space with a 63% adoption rate according to the recent [Shaping the Future of Generative AI Report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/gen-ai-2024) from the Linux Foundation.

The PyTorch Foundation was formed in 2022 with the goal to drive the adoption of AI tooling by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects centered around PyTorch and today remains a vibrant, collaborative hub created for and by the deep learning community. As we wrap up the year, let’s take a look back at a few highlights and how this year has been one of growth, collaboration, innovation, and community.

## 2024 Highlights: A Year of Growth and Impact

  

PyTorch accelerated its growth this year. Contributions are up 133%, from double the amount of  organizations worldwide compared to last year.

The project has seen 20% year-over-year growth in new repositories using PyTorch, and a 30% increase in forks and users this past year.

Over 70% of AI research implementations are now using PyTorch.

Statistics based on the [2024 Linux Foundation Annual Report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/publications/linux-foundation-annual-report-2024).

PyTorch Tools ecosystem grew by over 25%, enhancing both software and hardware capabilities. Working with all major cloud service providers, dozens of major software vendors, and industry partners, PyTorch is setting a new bar for the pace and breadth of AI innovation.

This year featured 4 milestone releases for PyTorch in the 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 releases. We observed the release of various hallmark features like [AOTInductor](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-2/#beta-aotinductor-ahead-of-time-compilation-and-deployment-for-torchexport-ed-programs), [FlashAttention-2 support](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-2/#beta-aotinductor-ahead-of-time-compilation-and-deployment-for-torchexport-ed-programs), [Tensor Parallelism](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-3/#beta-tensor-parallelism-introduces-more-efficient-ways-to-train-llms), a new [Python Custom Operator API](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-4/#beta-new-higher-level-python-custom-operator-api), and the introduction of [FlexAttention](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-5/#prototype-flexattention). Engineers from across PyTorch Foundation member companies have also come together to introduce support and optimizations for platforms like [Intel GPUs](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-4/#torchcompile-optimizations-for-aws-graviton-aarch64-linux-processors) (XPU), AWS [Graviton](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-4/#torchcompile-optimizations-for-aws-graviton-aarch64-linux-processors) processors, Inductor performance, etc.

Throughout the year the PyTorch Team has been working hard to introduce a number of new PyTorch-native libraries! The [ExecuTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/executorch-alpha/) team released their alpha in collaboration with partners from Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. then quickly followed with a [beta](https://pytorch.org/blog/executorch-beta/) focused on stability and adding MediaTek. [TorchTune](https://pytorch.org/blog/torchtune-fine-tune-llms/) established a PyTorch-native library for easily fine-tuning large language models. [TorchAO](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-native-architecture-optimization/) introduced a PyTorch native library that makes models faster and smaller by leveraging low bit dtypes, quantization and sparsity. [TorchCodec](https://pytorch.org/blog/torchcodec/) was launched to give developers a simple, performant, and PyTorch native way to decode videos into tensors. [TorchRec](https://pytorch.org/blog/torchrec-fbgemm-1/) 1.0 was released, the first stable release of the PyTorch native recommendation systems library. 

We’ve also had a number of strong technical showcases throughout the year to highlight how PyTorch can be used! [TorchTitan](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.06511v1) exhibited what an open source, PyTorch-native distributed training system could look like for training large language models (LLMs). [TorchChat](https://pytorch.org/blog/torchchat-local-llm-inference/) showcased how to seamlessly and performantly run LLMs across laptop, desktop, and mobile devices.

As well we were very excited to include [multiple new projects](https://pytorch.org/blog/enhancing-deep-learning/) into the PyTorch ecosystem throughout 2024, including the introduction of  [vLLM](https://pytorch.org/blog/vllm-joins-pytorch/) into the PyTorch Ecosystem, a state-of-the-art inference engine, which gives machine learning engineers an easy, fast, and cheap way of serving LLMs. If you are interested in joining the PyTorch Ecosystem, please [join](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ecosystem)!

In June in Paris, France we premiered the[ official PyTorch documentary](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-documentary/) on powering the AI Revolution that spotlights PyTorch’s vibrant ecosystem and its role in advancing AI innovation. The film unveiled the authentic narrative of PyTorch’s inception, attributing its existence to a dedicated group of unsung heroes driving technological innovation.

The [PyTorch Conference 2024](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-conference-2024-recap/), brought in triple the registrations compared to 2023, reflecting the rapid growth of AI and machine learning communities around open source technologies. The two day event included insightful talks, hands-on sessions, and lively discussions about the future of AI, covering everything from generative AI to large language models. 

A brand new Startup Showcase featured early-stage founders pitching their AI startups to a panel of top venture capitalists, a DL Compiler Mini-Summit took a deep dive into the advances in deep learning (DL) compilers that are transforming AI workloads, and a Fine-Tuning Mini-Summit brought together a thriving community of researchers, developers, practitioners and hobbyists to discuss topics like memory efficiency, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and performance at scale.

PyTorch Foundation welcomed new leadership this year.[ Executive Director Matt White](https://pytorch.org/blog/new-executive-director/) took the reins in April and immediately began raising the profile of PyTorch across the AI landscape. The[ Technical Advisory Council (TAC)](https://pytorch.org/tac) also elected[ new leadership](https://pytorch.org/blog/tac-elects-new-leadership/) with  Luca Antiga, Lightning AI as the Chair and Jiong Gong, Intel as Vice Chair. 

The[ PyTorch Governing Board](https://pytorch.org/governing-board) continued to set the direction and lead the Foundation in accomplishing its mission. The PyTorch Marketing and Outreach Committee developed programs to maximize the visibility of PyTorch and advance the interests of the community. The PyTorch CI Working Group assembled to successfully migrate the PyTorch CI pipeline to the Linux Foundation. 

Our community joined us on social media with 775 thousand followers strong across X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube with more than 12 million impressions of PyTorch content throughout the year.  The PyTorch Ecosystem also grew, adding many new projects to leverage PyTorch deep learning across many vertical domains.

PyTorch was mentioned in the media in top technology publications such as The New Stack’s article on [Why PyTorch Gets All the Love](https://thenewstack.io/why-pytorch-gets-all-the-love/) and InfoWorld’s article on how the TorchAO[ PyTorch library makes models faster and smaller](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3543651/pytorch-library-makes-models-faster-and-smaller.html).

We published 74 technical and community blogs, and nearly ten million people visited the PyTorch website throughout the year.

Thanks to each of you who helped make this year an outstanding success! The evolution and growth we’ve seen PyTorch undergo over the past year is driven by the passion, dedication, and ingenuity of this amazing community. Looking ahead to next year, we’re excited to build on this momentum as we continue to push the boundaries of AI. 

Save the date for the [PyTorch Conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/pytorch-conference-2025/) which will be held October 22-23, 2025 in San Francisco. 2025 promises even greater innovation and stronger community collaboration.
