We are thrilled to announce the successful completion of the H1 2024 PyTorch Docathon! The event was a resounding success, and we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants who made it possible. Dedication, expertise, and tireless efforts of our open-source contributors have once again helped us to improve PyTorch documentation.

This Docathon ran from June 4 through June 20 with more than 176 registrants. The energy and enthusiasm were palpable, and entrants were judged on the difficulty of submissions that resulted in over 50 merged pull requests. 

We want to give a special shout-out to our top contributors, who went above and beyond during this event. Your dedication and expertise have been invaluable in enhancing the PyTorch documentation and empowering developers worldwide.
