Special thanks to our keynote speakers: Piotr Bialecki, Ritchie Ng, Miquel Farré, Joe Spisak, Geeta Chauhan, and Suraj Subramanian who shared updates from the latest release of PyTorch, exciting work being done with partners, use case example from Disney, the growth and development of the PyTorch community in Asia Pacific, and latest contributor highlights.

If you missed the opening talks, you rewatch them here:

* [Evening/APAC Opening Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjU_6OaYKpw)

In addition to the talks, we had 71 posters covering various topics such as multimodal, NLP, compiler, distributed training, researcher productivity tools, AI accelerators, and more. From the event, it was clear that an underlying thread that ties all of these different projects together is the cross-collaboration of the PyTorch community. Thank you for continuing to push the state of the art with PyTorch!
