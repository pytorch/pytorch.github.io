Thank you to all who participated in our first ever PyTorch Docathon, the results have been nothing short of amazing! We want to extend our sincerest gratitude to all the participants who made this event a resounding success. Your passion, talent, and hard work have left an indelible mark on the PyTorch documentation.

The virtual Docathon ran from May 31 through June 15 with more than 230 registrants and more than 110 participants joining the Docathon Slack channel, the energy and enthusiasm were palpable. Entrants were judged on the difficulty of submissions that resulted in over 40 merged pull requests and the publication of four new tutorials and addition of one new example.

We want to give a special shout-out to our top contributors, who went above and beyond during this event. Your dedication and expertise have been invaluable in enhancing the PyTorch documentation and empowering developers worldwide.
