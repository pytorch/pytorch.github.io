In this blog, we will demonstrate how we achieve up to **50% throughput speedup** while achieving loss and evaluation benchmark parity in training over [FSDP1 bf16 training](https://pytorch.org/blog/maximizing-training-throughput/). We achieve this speedup by leveraging FSDP2, DTensor, and torch.compile with torchao’s float8 via linear layer updates (compute), and float8 all_gathers for weight communication. We showcase these improvements across a spectrum of Meta LLaMa model architecture sizes, ranging from small 1.8B model size all the way to 405B model size, making training faster than ever.

We demonstrate these improvements using the Meta Llama3 architecture, and then perform model quality studies at two scales: 100B tokens at 8B model size, and 50B tokens at 70B model size, which provide an exact comparison of float8 and bf16 training loss curves. We demonstrate that the loss curves result in identical loss convergence across these model training runs compared to the `bf16` counterpart. Further, we train a 3B model to 1T tokens using the FineWeb-edu dataset and run standard evaluation benchmarks to ensure that the model quality is intact and comparable to a `bf16` run.

At IBM Research, we plan to adopt these capabilities for our data ablations to improve the number of experiments we can perform in a given GPU budget. Longer term, we will follow up with a larger scale model run to demonstrate the end-to-end feasibility of `float8` training.


## What is Float8?  

The `float8` format for training models was introduced by NVIDIA, ARM, and Intel in a [2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05433) which demonstrated the feasibility of training using lower precision float8, without sacrificing model quality. With the introduction of newer GPUs like the NVIDIA Hopper series, FP8 training became feasible with the potential of more than 2x improvement in training throughput due to native float8 tensor core support. There are a few challenges to realize this promise:  \
(i) Enable the core model operations like `matmul` and `attention` in `float8`,  \
(ii) Enable `float8` training in a distributed framework, and  \
(iii) Enable weight communication between GPUs in `float8`.  \
While the `float8` `matmul` was enabled by NVIDIA libraries, the latter two were provided in recent updates to `FSDP2` and `torchao`.

In this blog, we are using [torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan) as the entry point for training, IBM’s deterministic data loader, the <code>float8</code> linear layer implementation from [torchao](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/float8&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1730743084184771&usg=AOvVaw21FdkNG452P-nDIO-hIwcW), and the <code>float8 all gather</code> from the latest PyTorch nightlies in conjunction with FSDP2. For this training, we are using the float8  per tensor (tensorwise) scaling granularity rather than rowwise. We leverage <code>torch.compile</code> to ensure that we get maximum performance gains. We are computing <code>attention</code> in <code>bf16</code> using SDPA and are currently working on moving this to float8 as well.


## Experiments

We perform various experiments to demonstrate the benefits of float8 training. The first is to ensure that model quality is not sacrificed. To verify this, we train an 8B model and 70B model for a few thousand steps and compare the loss curves between both the float8 and bf16 training run. Our experiments are performed on three different H100 clusters with 128, 256, and 512 H100 GPU configurations in very different environments to demonstrate reproducibility. The first cluster is customized on [Grand Teton](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/) in Meta with 400Gbps custom interconnect, the second is an IBM research cluster with 3.2Tbps Infiniband interconnect, and the third is an IBM Cloud cluster with 3.2Tbps RoCE interconnect for GPU-to-GPU communication. 


First, we plot the loss curve comparisons for both these models in the below figures to demonstrate loss parity for a few thousand steps.

*Figure 1: (a) 8B model loss parity for 2k steps, (b) 70B loss parity for 1k steps*

We observe that across these different models and in different environments, we obtain loss parity for the small scale of tokens. Next, we characterize the throughput gains for four different model sizes ranging from 1.8B to 405B. We explored the best batch size and activation checkpointing schemes for both the float8 and bf16 training runs to determine the tokens/sec/GPU (wps) metric and report the performance gain. For the 405B model, we leveraged `DTensor` for tensor parallel training with FSDP2. We use a sequence length of 8K for all our measurements.

*Table 1: Performance gains over bf16 (both bf16 and float8 use torch.compile)*

We observe from Table 1 that the gains for larger models (70B and 405B) reach up to 50%, the smaller models see gains between roughly 20 and 30%. In further experiments, we observed that the addition of `float8` `all_gather` enables a boost of ~5% beyond the compute itself in `float8`, which is inline with the observations in this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/efficient-pre-training-of-llama-3-like-model-architectures-using-torchtitan-on-amazon-sagemaker/).

Second, to demonstrate the effectiveness of an FP8 model, we trained a 3B model following the Llama3 architecture for 1T tokens using the FineWeb-edu dataset from Hugging Face. We performed evaluations using the `lm-eval-harness` framework and present a small portion of these results in the below table. We observe that the `bf16` performance is marginally better than the `float8` scores (about one percent). While some scores are significantly better with `bf16` (e.g., MMLU is 3 pts higher), we expect these gaps to vanish when the right hyper parameters are chosen and across larger scale training runs (e.g., the `bf16` run had half the batch size and it is well known that smaller batch size runs can improve evaluation scores).

Finally, we scale our experiments to 512 H100 GPUs on the IBM Cloud cluster. We were able to recreate the results and speedups that we observed even at 512 GPU scale. We summarize these results only for the large models in the below table (70B and 405B).

## Future work

We are also working on evaluating other forms of parallelism such as Context Parallelism. We plan to evaluate all of these features to demonstrate the composability and ability to make choices for training large scale models.
