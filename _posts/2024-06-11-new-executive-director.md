The PyTorch Foundation is excited to welcome Matt White, our new executive director. The PyTorch Foundation formed in 2022 with the goal to drive adoption of AI tooling by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects with PyTorch. Over the past 2 years, we’ve seen excellent growth across the project – with both contributor and member growth.

“I am honored to be a part of the PyTorch Foundation, working with such a passionate and skilled community," said Matt White. “I am looking forward to working with our contributors and members to advance the PyTorch ecosystem through research, cutting edge technologies and open source best practices.”

Matt is a career technologist, researcher and innovator and has over 25 years of experience in AI, data, autonomous systems and simulations. He is the Co-founder and Chair of the Open Metaverse Foundation, a part of the Linux Foundation. Previously, Matt was the Director of the Generative AI Commons at the Linux Foundation, leading the advancement of open science and open-source artificial intelligence projects.
