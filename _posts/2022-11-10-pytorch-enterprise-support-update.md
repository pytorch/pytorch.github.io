On May 25, 2021, we announced the [PyTorch Enterprise Support Program](https://pytorch.org/blog/announcing-pytorch-enterprise/) (ESP) that enabled providers to develop and offer tailored enterprise-grade support to their customers.

The program enabled Program certified service providers to develop and offer tailored enterprise-grade support to their customers through contribution of hotfixes and other improvements requested by PyTorch enterprise users who were developing models in production at scale for mission-critical applications. However, as we evaluate community feedback, we found ongoing ESP support was not necessary at this time and will immediately divert these resources to other areas to improve the user experience for the entire community.

Today, we are removing the PyTorch long-term support (LTS 1.8.2) download link from the “Get Started” page from the “[Start Locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)” download option in order to simplify the user experience. One can download PyTorch v1.8.2 in [previous versions](/get-started/previous-versions/#v182-with-lts-support). Please note that it is only supported for Python while it is being deprecated. If there are any updates to ESP/LTS, we will update future blogs.
