title: "Lightning AI Joins the PyTorch Foundation as a Premier Member"
---

The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that Lightning AI has joined as a premier member.

Lightning AI is the company behind PyTorch Lightning, the platform and open-source framework for companies to build and deploy AI products leveraging the latest generative AI models.

“This is a very important milestone for Lightning AI and the PyTorch Lightning community,” remarks Luca Antiga, Chief Technology Officer of Lightning AI. “By joining the PyTorch Foundation, we are strengthening our commitment to boost the adoption of PyTorch across industries. We look forward to partnering with the Foundation to push the vision of PyTorch forward.”

PyTorch Lightning is one of the leading projects in the PyTorch ecosystem, allowing developers to build, train, fine-tune and deploy AI models at scale. PyTorch Lightning is helping drive the rapid adoption of PyTorch by both the research community and the enterprise.

“Lightning AI has been a great steward of the AI community, and notably a key contributor to PyTorch over the years,” said PyTorch Foundation Executive Director Ibrahim Haddad. “Their goal of making AI research scalable directly aligns with our mission at the foundation.”

As a premier member, Lightning AI is granted one seat to the PyTorch Foundation Governing Board. The Board sets policy through our bylaws, mission and vision statements, describing the overarching scope of foundation initiatives, technical vision, and direction.

We’re happy to welcome Luca Antiga, Chief Technology Officer at Lightning AI, to our board. Luca joined the Lightning AI team in April 2021 when the Tensorwerk team joined Grid AI. Prior to joining Lightning AI, Luca co-founded Orobix, an applied AI company, and Tensorwerk. He was an early core contributor to PyTorch and co-authored Deep Learning with PyTorch (Manning).
