The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that Snowflake has joined as a general member.

Snowflake enables thousands of organizations to unite siloed data, discover and securely share data, power data applications, and execute diverse AI/ML and analytic workloads across multiple clouds and geographies.

"By joining the PyTorch community, we know that Snowflake will help accelerate data warehousing solutions and cutting-edge AI frameworks. This showcases the commitment to advancing innovation for data and artificial intelligence,” said Ibrahim Haddad, Executive Director, PyTorch Foundation. “We are thrilled to have Snowflake join the PyTorch Foundation, marking a significant stride in the convergence of data management and deep learning technologies."

Snowflake enables collaboration with AI technologies to handle the storage and analysis of large datasets generated by machine learning and AI applications through scalability and SQL support.

With the integrated repository of Python libraries from Anaconda in Snowpark, Snowflake users have always had a streamlined experience to deploy pre-trained PyTorch models in Snowflake to easily and securely make them a part of applications. Now with the addition of GPU instances in Snowpark Container Services (in private preview), training and other computationally intensive processing using PyTorch will also be streamlined, providing teams with an end-to-end solution for AI development and deployment.

"Most if not all of our customers incorporate open source software as part of their data stacks, so it is critical for us to work with open source ecosystems like the PyTorch Foundation, alongside incorporating open source to meet the needs of our customers," said Adrien Treuille, Co-Founder of Streamlit, Director of Product Management at Snowflake. "As AI developers continue to integrate their models as part of applications, the power of Snowflake and PyTorch — coupled with Streamlit as the powerful front-end — creates near-limitless innovation for developers looking to build next-generation apps and unlock even more use cases."
