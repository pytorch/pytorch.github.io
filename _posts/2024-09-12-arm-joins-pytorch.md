The PyTorch Foundation, a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem, is announcing today that [Arm](https://www.arm.com/) has joined as a premier member.

Arm designs a high-performance, power-efficient compute platform with unmatched scalability, supporting a vast ecosystem of developers deploying AI at the edge and in the cloud, ranging from the Arm instances offered by all major cloud service providers to smartphones, laptops, software-defined vehicles and more.

“Our continued investments in software are accelerating development and AI performance for over 20 million software developers, ensuring they can develop for Arm, on Arm,” said Alex Spinelli, VP Developer Technology at Arm. “PyTorch is a pivotal framework in advancing AI research and development. This membership demonstrates our strong commitment to open source - ensuring PyTorch just works on Arm and can leverage seamless acceleration for the most demanding AI models, now and in the future.”

Last year at the PyTorch Conference, Arm partnered with Apple, Meta and Qualcomm to release [ExecuTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-edge/), an end-to-end solution for enabling on-device inference capabilities across mobile and edge devices including wearables, embedded devices and microcontrollers.

"We're thrilled to welcome Arm to the PyTorch Foundation. As we look to the future of AI and machine learning, the role of specialized silicon and edge devices becomes increasingly crucial. Arm's expertise in these areas will be invaluable as we work to make PyTorch more efficient and accessible across a wider range of hardware,” said PyTorch Foundation Executive Director Matt White. “This collaboration underscores our commitment to fostering innovation and expanding PyTorch's capabilities to meet the evolving needs of developers and researchers worldwide."

As a premier member, Arm is granted one seat to the PyTorch Foundation Governing Board. The Board sets policy through our bylaws, mission and vision statements, describing the overarching scope of foundation initiatives, technical vision, and direction.

We’re happy to welcome Alex Spinelli, VP Developer Technology at Arm, to our board. Prior to Arm, Alex was VP of Product for Core Machine Learning at Google, where he led Google’s technology and infrastructure for building, training, and serving machine learning, including the TensorFlow stack.
