<p>Knowing the physical structure of proteins is an important part of the drug discovery process. Machine learning (ML) algorithms like AlphaFold v2.0 significantly reduce the cost and time needed to generate usable protein structures. These projects have also inspired development of AI-driven workflows for de novo protein design and protein-ligand interaction analysis.</p>
