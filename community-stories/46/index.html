<p>Grapheme to Phoneme (G2P) is a function that generates pronunciations (phonemes) for words based on their written form (graphemes). It has an important role in automatic speech recognition systems, natural language processing, and text-to-speech engines. In Cisco’s Webex Assistant, we use G2P modelling to assist in resolving person names from voice. See here for further details of various techniques we use to build robust voice assistants.</p>
