<p>In this tutorial, we’ll build a simple machine learning pipeline using a BERT word embedding model and the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to recommend wines based on user inputted preferences. To create and power this recommendation engine, we’ll leverage AWS’s SageMaker platform, which provides a fully managed way for us to train and deploy our service.</p>
