<p>Healthcare providers need to be able to verify that they’re maintaining the highest operating safety and efficacy standards. Those standards are set by a national accreditation organization whose surveyors, often healthcare professionals themselves, regularly visit facilities and document situations that might need to be corrected or brought back in line with the latest rules and policies. That assessment and accreditation process generates a huge amount of data, and even the most experienced surveyors struggle to keep ahead of the ongoing development of thousands of policy rules that might be relevant in any particular scenario. Vaagan and his team took on the task of fixing the issue by building a machine learning solution that could ingest text from those reports and return a top ten list of the latest associated rules with unprecedented accuracy. They used Azure technology, development tools, and services to bring that solution to fruition. Crayon customers report clear time savings with the new healthcare solution. Just as important, the solution provides consistent responses that aren’t subject to the vagaries of individual interpretation or potentially out-of-date data.</p>
