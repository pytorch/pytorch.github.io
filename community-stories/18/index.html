<p>In this blog series, our aim is to highlight the nuances of Machine Learning in Tubiâ€™s Ad-based Video on Demand (AVOD) space as practiced at Tubi. Machine Learning helps solve myriad problems involving recommendations, content understanding and ads. We extensively use PyTorch for several of these use cases as it provides us the flexibility, computational speed and ease of implementation to train large scale deep neural networks using GPUs.</p>
