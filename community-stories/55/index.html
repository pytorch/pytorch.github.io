<p>In this talk, scientist Lindsey Gray and Ph.D. student Matthias Fey co-examine how the challenges of High Energy Particle Physics are driving the need for more efficient research and development pipelines in neural network development. In particular, they look at the additions made to PyTorch Geometric, which allow Graph Neural Network models to be compiled by the PyTorch JIT, significantly easing the process of deploying such networks at scale.</p>
