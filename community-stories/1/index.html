<p>At Outreach, a leading sales engagement platform, our data science team is a driving force behind our innovative product portfolio largely driven by deep learning and AI. We recently announced enhancements to the Outreach Insights feature, which is powered by the proprietary Buyer Sentiment deep learning model developed by the Outreach Data Science team. This model allows sales teams to deepen their understanding of customer sentiment through the analysis of email reply content, moving from just counting the reply rate to classification of the replierâ€™s intent.</p>
