Open Source AI has become a major trend in the industry, with even many digital giants adopting an Open Source approach. While Open Source AI isn't magic, it does offer the potential to address many challenges more effectively than proprietary AI models.

This first edition of the Paris Open Source AI Summit will bring together global leaders and industry players to address these issues. The summit will aim to establish a common set of ideas, vocabulary and definitions to create a shared understanding of the current state of Open Source AI.
