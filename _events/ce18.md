[ACM SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) is a special interest group (SIG) devoted to computer graphics (GRAPH) within the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) (ACM), the worldâ€™s largest educational and scientific computing society devoted to advancing computing as a science and a profession. Its annual conference, first held in 1974, is the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques worldwide. At SIGGRAPH 2025, we boldly look toward the future, imagining how humanity and technology will be increasingly connected and examining how we can create a future that connects our physical and digital worlds for the better.
