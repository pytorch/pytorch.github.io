The Docathon, similar to a hackathon, is an event focused on improving PyTorch documentation with help from our community. Quality documentation is crucial for any technology, and by enhancing it, we make it easier for new users to start with PyTorch, use its features effectively, and accelerate the shift from research to production in machine learning.  See our previous events here and here.

#### Why Participate

The Docathon is an inclusive event designed to be accessible to newcomers, requiring only a basic understanding of Python, PyTorch, and Machine Learning, with some tasks not even requiring these skills. It offers a rewarding experience as participants can see the direct impact of their contributions on the project's usability and accessibility. The Docathon promotes a collaborative environment, allowing participants to work with other contributors and PyTorch maintainers, fostering the exchange of ideas and networking. It also provides a rich learning experience, offering the opportunity to explore PyTorch modules, update docstrings, and test tutorials.


#### Event Details
