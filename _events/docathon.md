**Date**: May 31, 2023  

We are excited to announce the first-ever PyTorch Docathon! 

The Docathon is a hackathon-style event focused on improving documentation by enlisting the community's help. Documentation is a crucial aspect of any technology. 

By improving the documentation, we can make it easier for users to get started with PyTorch, help them understand how to use its features effectively, and ultimately accelerate research to production in the field of machine learning.

Details for the Docathon will be announced at the kick-off call on May 31.
