**Date**: April 30, 2025  
**Location**: Austin, TX

The Triton framework provides a hardware agnostic way of programming and targeting GPUs. As Triton becomes more widely adopted, it will be essential in understanding how to write, optimize and troubleshoot the Triton kernel in order to optimize GPU efficiency for algorithms. Join the PyTorch community meetup to learn how Red Hat, Intel, AMD, IBM Research and University of Texas are working on developing Triton kernels.
