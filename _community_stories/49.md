Everyone prefers to use their mother tongue when communicating with chat agents and other automated services. However, for languages like Hungarian—spoken by only 15 million people—the market size will often be viewed as too small for large companies to create software, tools or applications that can process Hungarian text as input. Recognizing this need, the Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team from University of Pécs decided to step up. Using Microsoft AI Solutions and ONNX Runtime solutions, it built and trained its own BERT-large model in native Hungarian in under 200 hours and total build cost of 1,000 euro.
