Performing surgery is largely about decision making. As Dr. Frank Spencer put it in 1978, “A skillfully performed operation is about 75% decision making and 25% dexterity”. Five decades later, and the surgical field is finally — albeit gradually — implementing advances in data science and AI to enhance surgeons’ ability to make the best decisions in the operating room. That’s where theator comes in: the company is re-imagining surgery with a Surgical Intelligence platform that leverages highly advanced AI, specifically machine learning and computer vision technology, to analyze every step, event, milestone, and critical junction of surgical procedures — significantly boosting surgeons’ overall performance.
