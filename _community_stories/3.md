NASA and IBM are working together to create foundation models based on NASA’s data sets — including geospatial data — with the goal of accelerating the creation of AI models.

Foundation models are trained on large, broad data sets, then used to train other AI models by using targeted and smaller datasets. Foundation models can be used for different tasks and can apply information about one situation to another. One real-world example of a foundation model at work is ChatGPT3, which was built with the foundation model, GPT3.
