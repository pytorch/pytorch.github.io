Software innovator Bentley Systems offers a broad portfolio of solutions to help the organizations that design, build, and operate the world’s infrastructure assets. The company uses machine learning in its flagship product to read disparate paper-based asset data and transform it into consolidated digital data. To speed up and formalize this process, Bentley created a machine learning operations framework using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and PyTorch. Developers’ speed and job satisfaction have shot up since they began using this stable, reproducible framework, which easily gets their code into the cloud, accelerating delivery by three to five times and significantly increasing efficiency.
