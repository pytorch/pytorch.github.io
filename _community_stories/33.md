Personalization is ubiquitous on most platforms today. Supercharged by connectivity, and scaled by machine learning, most experiences on the internet are tailored to our personal tastes. Peloton classes offer a diversity of instructors, languages, fitness disciplines, durations and intensity. Each Member has specific fitness goals, schedule, fitness equipment, and level of skill or strength. This diversity of content and individuality of Member needs at massive scale creates the opportunity for a recommender system to create a personalized experience on the Peloton platform.
