AI21 Labs uses machine learning to develop language models focused on understanding meaning, and in 2021 it set a goal to train the recently released Jurassic-1 Jumbo, an autoregressive language model with 178 billion parameters. Developers who register for beta testing will get access to Jurassic-1 Jumbo and can immediately start to customize the model for their use case. The software startup wanted to train the model efficiently, so it looked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and built a solution using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Choosing Amazon EC2 gave the company control over the training process, including node allocation.
