Sensitive information such as healthcare data is often siloed within health organization boundaries. This has posed a challenge to machine learning models used by the health and life sciences industry that require data for training purposes. To improve patient care and accelerate health industry progression, the Microsoft Health & Life Sciences AI group used a federated learning setup to train their biomedical natural language processing service, Text Analytics for Health, while preserving the trust boundaries of siloed data. The federated learning framework was built using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and open-source technologies to help organizations analyze siloed data and build new applications without compromising data privacy.
