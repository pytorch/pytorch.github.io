Wayve wants to accelerate and scale autonomous vehicle (AV) development by using vision-based machine learning for rapid prototyping and quick iteration. So, it developed a platform that uses the open-source machine learning framework PyTorch with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to gather, manage, and process millions of hours of driving data per year—petabytes of data—consisting of images, GPS data, and data from other sensors. Wayve now has the scalable capacity to build and iterate driving models for complex urban environments, adjust models more nimbly, and adapt to new environments more readily.
