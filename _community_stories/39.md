Many of the experiences people enjoy on Facebook and Instagram are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). A number of them, like Assistant, Avatars, and AR effects, cannot be powered by server-side AI due to latency, network bandwidth, and other constraints. Running AI on-device —that is, directly on a phone, tablet, or even a pair of smart glasses — offers huge advantages over constantly sending data back to a server. It’s faster, and it creates a privacy-enhancing experience for people who use our platforms. However, on-device AI presents new challenges, since it requires coping with devices that have a small battery, far less powerful processors, and less memory than a server in a data center.
