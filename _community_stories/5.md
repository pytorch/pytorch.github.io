In this webinar, Bob Chesebrough of Intel guides you through the steps he took to create a clipped image with background clutter removed from the image. He accomplished this using monocular depth estimation with PyTorch. This could potentially be used to automate structure from motion and other image-related tasks where you want to highlight or focus on a single portion of an image, particularly for identifying parts of the image that were closest to the camera. Specifically, he used depth estimation on a couple of images that he took at a natural history museum to capture just the dinosaur in the foreground, eliminating the background murals, lights, and building structure. The cool thing about this algorithm is that it creates a depth estimate from a single image!
