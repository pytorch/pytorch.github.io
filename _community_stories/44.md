At deepset, weâ€™re building the next-level search engine for business documents. Our core product, Haystack, is an open-source framework that enables developers to utilize the latest NLP models for semantic search and question answering at scale. Our software as a service (SaaS) platform, Haystack Hub, is used by developers from various industries, including finance, legal, and automotive, to find answers in all kinds of text documents.
