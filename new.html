        <h3>Foundation Governance</h3>
        <h4 class="mt-3">Governing Board</h4>
        <p class="lead">The Governing Board plays a crucial role in steering the PyTorch Foundation's strategic direction. It facilitates business decisions encompassing alliance formation, membership expansion, and budget allocation, ensuring resources are optimized to support the PyTorch Foundation mission and enrich the PyTorch community.
        <br/><br/>Membership to the Governing Board is composed of representatives from Premier Members.</p>

        </a>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Marketing & Outreach Committee</h4>
        <p class="lead">The Marketing and Outreach Committee works closely with Foundation staff to develop programs that will maximize the visibility of PyTorch and advance the interests of the Governing Board and the PyTorch community. The committee designs, develops, and executes marketing programs on behalf of the PyTorch Foundation.        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Technical Coordination</h3>
        <h4 class="mt-3">Technical Advisory Council (TAC)</h4>
        <p class="lead">The PyTorch Technical Advisory Council (TAC) serves as the technical governing body for the PyTorch Foundation. It oversees open source standards, best practices, curriculum, and the technical vision of the foundation. The TAC's outputs are committed to an open source ecosystem and standardized best practices.
        <br/><br/>TAC meetings are public and open to anyone in the community that wants to participate.  Participants also include one voting contact from each Premier Member, and PyTorch Lead Maintainers, based on availability. </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">CI and Multi-cloud Working Groups</h4>
        <p class="lead">The CI Working Group was assembled to migrate the PyTorch CI pipeline to the Linux Foundation. After completing the migration in September 2024, the group has shifted focus to enhance and manage the CI infrastructure.  The Multi-cloud Working Group is developing technical solutions to expand the CI infrastructure into multiple cloud technologies. 
        <br/><br/>Membership in these working groups is comprised of Premier Member representatives.  </p>
