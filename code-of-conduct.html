        <p class="lead">
        The PyTorch Foundation is committed to fostering an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment for everyone involved in the PyTorch Foundation community. This commitment extends across all Foundation activities, including but not limited to our technical projects, events, communication channels, and social media presence. We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
