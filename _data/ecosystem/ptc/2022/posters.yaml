  description: "PathAI is a Boston based company focussed on improving patient care using AI powered pathology. We heavily use PyTorch for building our ML systems, specifically training and deploying models on large gigapixel pathology images. In this case study, we highlight our use of PyTorch to build, experiment and deploy Additive Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models. Additive MIL is a novel MIL technique built using PyTorch Lightning which allows end-to-end learning from millions of pixels while providing granular interpretability of spatial heatmaps. These models allow for the exact computation of the extent to which each smaller region in the gigapixel-sized image contributes to the final model prediction. This enables class-wise excitatory and inhibitory contributions to be visualized on top of the pathology image. This informs the practitioners of model failures and guides the pathologists to areas of interest. All this is made possible due to PyTorch's rapid research-to-prototype-to-deployment iteration cycle."

  description: "TorchUnmix is a library which aims to provide automatic stain unmixing and augmentation for histopathology whole slide images. Separation of histochemical stains (unmixing) is performed by orthonormal transformation of the RGB pixel data from predefined light absorption coefficients called stain vectors [1]. Precomputed publicly available stain vector definitions are often used, but inter-laboratory variation due to the histology and/or image acquisition process is common, yielding suboptimal unmixing results. Classical stain vector estimation methods rely on abundant distribution of stains, making them less practical for sparser distributions as observed from immunohistochemical stains. Geis et al. proposed a method based on k-means clustering of pixel values in the hue-saturation-density color space to determine optimal stain vectors which has been used in this work [2]. While stain vectors may be used for quantification of individual stains, TorchUnmix also provides functionalities to perform stain augmentation. Stain augmentation is a method used during the training process of deep learning models to improve generalization by unmixing the image, stochastically modifying the individual stains, and then compositing the stains into the final augmented image [3]. To our knowledge, no other libraries fully implement the above methods in PyTorch, utilizing GPU-acceleration. Additionally, TorchUnmix has extended all calculations used to perform the automatic stain unmixing and augmentation to operate on batches of images, drastically accelerating execution performance speeds in comparison to other libraries."

  description: "Scaling machine learning is hard: Cloud platform solutions like SageMaker can limit flexibility, but a custom distributed framework is often too hard to implement. In effect, ML engineers struggle to scale their workloads from local prototyping to the cloud. \n The Ray AI Runtime ('Ray AIR') is an integrated collection of machine learning libraries built around distributed computing framework Ray. It provides an easy to use interface for scalable data processing, training, tuning, batch prediction, and online serving. Adapting existing PyTorch training loops to Ray AIR's PyTorch integration needs as little as 10 lines of code changes. And scaling from local development to the cloud needs no code changes at all."

  description: "Mixed Mode autodiff combines back-propagation and forward differentiation. Both modes have pros and cons: Back-propagation is efficient for scalar functions with many trainable parameters. Back-propagation uses memory for intermediate results, requires data flow reversal, scales poorly for many output variables. Forward differentiation is straightforward to implement, memory-efficient, and easy to vectorize/parallelize or port to new hardware. Forward mode scales poorly with large number of trainable parameters. AutoMAD makes it possible to combine both modes. Use forward differentiation for some layers, while using back-prop for others."

  description: "linear_operator (https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator) is a library for structured linear algebra built on PyTorch. It provides a LinearOperator class that represents a tensor that is never instantiated but is instead accessed through operations like matrix multiplication, solves, decompositions, and indexing. These objects use custom linear algebra operations that can exploit particular matrix structure (e.g. diagonal, block-diagonal, triangular, Kronecker, etc.) in computations in order to achieve substantial (many orders of magnitude) improvements in time and memory complexity. Moreover, many efficient linear algebra operations (e.g. solves, decompositions, indexing, etc.) can be automatically generated from the LinearOperator's matmul function. This makes it extremely easy to compose or implement custom LinearOperators. \n The key aspect that makes linear_operator easy to use in PyTorch code is its integration with the `__torch_function__` interface - Common linear algebra operations (such as matrix multiplication, solve, SVD) are mapped to the respective torch functions (`__matmul__`, `torch.linalg.solve`, `torch.linalg.svd`), so that LinearOperator objects can be used as drop-in replacements for dense tensors even in existing code. LinearOperator operations themselves may return LinearOperator objects, automatically keeping track of algebraic structure after each computation. As a result, users never need to reason about what efficient linear algebra routines to use (so long as the input elements defined by the user encode known input structure)."

We also developed a novel neural network architecture, GatedPINN [1], introducing adaptable domain decomposition into the training of Physics-informed Neural Networks based on the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Distributed large-scale training of our GatedPINN is facilitated by Horovod, resulting in excellent GPU utilization making Neural Solvers ready for the upcoming exascale era. Upcoming projects involve higher dimensional problems such as 3d laser systems and coupled models to study the Vlasov-Maxwell system.

  description: "Federated Learning with Differential Privacy has witnessed an increased adoption as one of the most promising ways to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy. Existing models in Meta around people attributes are mostly built on traditional centralized machine learning methods. Recently, due to the increasing concerns about user privacy internally and externally, Machine Learning teams at Meta are experiencing either signal loss or restriction on applying new features in models to further improve model performance. In this paper, we are introducing a generic framework we built for preparing and generating models for federated learning. The model preparation process is to utilize traditional machine learning to understand model structure and hyperparameters for the target problems including training, inference, evaluations. It also requires a simulation process to train the target model structure and understand the simulated environment on the server side to tune FL specific hyperparameters. \n The model generation process is to generate device compatible models, which can be used directly on users’ devices for federated learning. We applied the FL framework on our on-device models, and integrated with device signals to improve user experience and protect user privacy."

  description: "We introduce Better Transformer, the PyTorch project to accelerate Transformers for inference and training with out-of-the-box enablement by implementing the Better Transformer ‘fastpath’. Fastpath accelerates many of the most commonly executed functions in Transformer models. Starting with PyTorch 1.13, the PyTorch Core API is implemented with accelerated operations to deliver up to 2x-4x speedups on many Transformer models, such as BERT and XLM-R. Accelerated operations are based on (1) operator and kernel fusion and (2) exploiting sparsity created by variable sequence-length NLP batches. In addition to improving MultiHeadAttention with fastpath, the model also includes sparsity support for MultiHeadAttention and TransformerEncoder modules to take advantage of variable sequence-length information with Nested Tensors for NLP models. \n At present, we enable torchtext and Hugging Face domain libraries with Better Transformer, delivering significant speedups for text, image, and audio models. Starting with the next release, PyTorch core will include even faster fused kernels and training support. You can preview these features today with PyTorch Nightlies, the nightly preview builds of the upcoming PyTorch release."

  description: "This talk dives into recent advances in PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) that have enabled better throughput, memory savings, and extensibility. These improvements have unblocked using FSDP for models of different modalities and for varying model and data sizes. We will share best practices to apply these features to specific use cases such as XLMR, FLAVA, ViT, DHEN, and GPT3-style models."

  description: "ML development is often stymied by incompatibilities between frameworks and hardware, forcing developers to compromise on technologies when building ML solutions. OpenXLA is a community-led and open-source ecosystem of ML compiler and infrastructure projects being co-developed by AI/ML leaders including Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Arm, Apple, Google, Intel, Meta, NVIDIA, and more. It will address this challenge by letting ML developers build their models on leading frameworks and execute them with high performance across any hardware backend. This flexibility will let developers make the right choice for their project, rather than being locked into decisions by closed systems. Our community will start by collaboratively evolving the XLA compiler and StableHLO, a portable ML compute operation set that makes frameworks easier to deploy across different hardware options."

  description: "The limited GPU memory resources can often hinder the performance of GPU-accelerated applications. While PyTorch’s Caching Allocator aims to minimize the number of expensive memory allocations and deallocations and maximize the efficient utilization of GPU memory resources, our study of common deep learning models revealed significant memory fragmentation problems. In some cases, up to 50% of GPU memory is wasted. To better understand the root causes of memory fragmentation, we developed a tool that visualizes GPU memory usage in two ways: the allocator view and the block view. The allocator view presents memory usage with each allocation or deallocation event, and the block view shows the changes in specific memory blocks over time. Our analysis revealed the considerable potential to save GPU memory, which would relieve the bottleneck of limited resources. By employing strategies such as swapping, activation recomputation, and memory defragmentation, we were able to reduce GPU memory waste significantly."

  description: "In brainchop project, we bring high fidelity pre-trained deep learning models for volumetric analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) right to the browsers of scientists and clinicians with no requirement on their technical skills in setting up AI-solutions. All of this in an extensible open-source framework. Our tool is the first front-end MRI segmentation tool on the web that supports full brain volumetric processing in a single pass inside a browser. This property is powered by our lightweight and reliable deep learning model Meshnet that enables volumetric processing of the entire brain at once, which leads to increased accuracy with modest computational requirements. High-quality client-side processing solves the privacy problem, as the data does not need to leave the client. Moreover, browser-based implementation is able to take advantage of available hardware acceleration regardless of the brand or architecture.\n GitHub: https://github.com/neuroneural/brainchop"

  description: "Holding the line of performance is challenging for ML frameworks like PyTorch. The existing AI benchmarks like MLPerf are end-to-end, therefore require large volumes of datasets, at-scale GPU clusters, and long benchmarking time. We develop TorchBench, a novel AI benchmark suite which highlights with minimal data inputs, single GPU, and milliseconds-per-test latencies. TorchBench is now deployed as part of the PyTorch nightly release process, guarding performance/correctness regressions and testing experimental PyTorch features on SOTA machine learning models."

  description: "OpenFold, developed by Columbia University, is an open-source protein structure prediction model implemented with PyTorch. The goal of OpenFold is to verify that AlphaFold 2 — DeepMind's protein structure prediction model — can be reproduced from scratch and beyond that, make components of the system available to like-minded researchers and academics so they can build on top of it. During this research, Weights & Biases was used to accelerate OpenFold’s reproduction of AlphaFold 2. The collaborative nature of W&B allowed for insights to scale from a single researcher to the entire team and helped solve the reproducibility challenge in ML."
