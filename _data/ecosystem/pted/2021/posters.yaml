    PennyLane allows you to train quantum circuits just like neural networks!,
    This poster showcases how PennyLane can be interfaced with PyTorch to enable training
    of quantum and hybrid machine learning models. The outputs of a quantum circuit
    are provided as a Torch tensor with a defined gradient. We highlight how this
    functionality can be used to explore new paradigms in machine learning, including
    the use of hybrid models for transfer learning.

    TorchScript is the bridge between PyTorch's flexible eager mode to
    more deterministic and performant graph mode suitable for production deployment.
    As part of PyTorch 1.9 release, TorchScript will launch a few features that we'd
    like to share with you earlier, including a) a new formal language specification
    that defines the exact subset of Python/PyTorch features supported in TorchScript;
    b) Profile-Directed Typing that reduces the burden of converting a loosely-typed
    eager model into a strictly-typed TorchScript model; c) A TorchScript profiler
    that can shed light on performance characteristics of TorchScript model. We are

    Brevitas is an open-source PyTorch library for quantization-aware training.
    Thanks to its flexible design at multiple levels of abstraction, Brevitas generalizes
    the typical uniform affine quantization paradigm adopted in the deep learning
    community under a common set of unified APIs. Brevitas provides a platform to
    both ML practitioners and researchers to either apply built-in state-of-the-art
    techniques in training for reduced-precision inference, or to implement novel
    quantization-aware training algorithms. Users can target supported inference toolchains,
    such as onnxruntime, TVM, Vitis AI, FINN or PyTorch itself, or experiment with
    hypothetical target hardware platforms. In particular, when combined with the
    flexibility of Xilinx FPGAs through the FINN toolchain, Brevitas supports the
    co-design of novel hardware building blocks in a machine-learning driven fashion.
    Within Xilinx, Brevitas has been adopted by various research projects concerning
    quantized neural networks, as well as in large scale deployments targeting custom
    programmable logic accelerators.

    'Pytorch enables building models with complex inputs and outputs, including
    time-series data, text and audiovisual data. However, such models require expertise
    and time to build, often spent on tedious tasks like cleaning the data or transforming
    it into a format that is expected by the models.


    Thus, pre-trained models are often used as-is when a researcher wants to experiment
    only with a specific facet of a problem. See, as examples, FastAI''s work into
    optimizers, schedulers, and gradual training through pre-trained residual models,
    or NLP projects with Hugging Face models as their backbone.


    We think that, for many of these problems, we can automatically generate a "good
    enough" model and data-processing pipeline from just the raw data and the endpoint.
    To address this situation, we are developing MindsDB, an open-source, PyTorch-based
    ML platform that works inside databases via SQL commands. It is built with a modular
    approach, and in this talk we are going to focus on Lightwood, the stand-alone
    core component that performs machine learning automation on top of the PyTorch
    framework.


    Lightwood automates model building into 5 stages: (1) classifying each feature
    into a "data type", (2) running statistical analyses on each column of a dataset,
    (3) fitting multiple models to normalize, tokenize, and generate embeddings for
    each feature, (4) deploying the embeddings to fit a final estimator, and (5) running
    an analysis on the final ensemble to evaluate it and generate a confidence model.
    It can generate quick "baseline" models to benchmark performance for any custom
    encoder representation of a data type and can also serve as scaffolding for investigating
    new hypotheses (architectures, optimizers, loss-functions, hyperparameters, etc).


    We aim to present our benchmarks covering wide swaths of problem types and illustrate
    how Lightwood can be useful for researchers and engineers through a hands-on demo.'

    'Many domains leverage the extraordinary predictive performance of
    machine learning algorithms. However, there is an increasing need for transparency
    of these models in order to justify deploying them in applied settings. Developing
    trustworthy models is a great challenge, as they are usually optimized for accuracy,
    relegating the fit between the true and predicted distributions to the background
    [1]. This concept of obtaining predicted probability estimates that match the
    true likelihood is also known as calibration.


    Contemporary ML models generally exhibit poor calibration. There are several methods
    that aim at producing calibrated ML models [2, 3]. Inductive conformal prediction
    (ICP) is a simple yet powerful framework to achieve this, offering strong guarantees
    about the error rates of any machine learning model [4]. ICP provides confidence
    scores and turns any point prediction into a prediction region through nonconformity
    measures, which indicate the degree of inherent strangeness a data point presents
    when compared to a calibration data split.


    In this work, we discuss the integration of ICP with MindsDB --an open source
    AutoML framework-- successfully replacing its existing quantile loss approach
    for confidence estimation capabilities.

    Our contribution is threefold. First, we present a study on the effect of a "self-aware"
    neural network normalizer in the width of predicted region sizes (also known as
    efficiency) when compared to an unnormalized baseline. Our benchmarks consider
    results for over 30 datasets of varied domains with both categorical and numerical
    targets. Second, we propose an algorithm to dynamically determine the confidence
    level based on a target size for the predicted region, effectively prioritizing
    efficiency over a minimum error rate. Finally, we showcase the results of a nonconformity
    measure specifically tailored for small datasets.

    'FairScale is a library that extends basic PyTorch capabilities while
    adding new SOTA techniques for high performance and large scale training on one
    or multiple machines. FairScale makes available the latest distributed training
    techniques in the form of composable modules and easy to use APIs.


    Machine Learning (ML) training at scale traditionally means data parallelism to
    reduce training time by using multiple devices to train on larger batch size.
    Nevertheless, with the recent increase of ML models sizes data parallelism is
    no longer enough to satisfy all "scaling" needs. FairScale provides several options
    to overcome some of the limitations to scale.


    For scaling training that is bottlenecked by memory (optimizer state, intermediate
    activations, parameters), FairScale provides APIs that have implemented optimizer,
    gradient and parameter sharding. This will allow users to train large models using
    devices in a more memory efficient manner.


    To overcome the memory required for large models FairScale provides various flavors
    of pipeline and model parallelism, MOE (Mixture Of Experts) layer, and Offload
    models. Those methods allow to perform computation only of shards of the models
    across multiple devices with micro batches of data to maximize device efficiency.


    FairScale also provides modules to aid users to scale batch size effectively without
    changing their existing learning rate hyperparameter - AdaScale - and save memory
    with checkpoint activation of intermediate layers.


    FairScale has also been integrated into Pytorch Lightening, HuggingFace, FairSeq,
    VISSL, and MMF to enable users of those frameworks to take advantage of its features.'

    TorchStudio is a standalone software based on PyTorch and LibTorch.
    It aims to simplify the creation, training and iterations of PyTorch models. It
    runs locally on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS. It can load, analyze and explore PyTorch
    datasets from the TorchVision or TorchAudio categories, or custom datasets with
    any number of inputs and outputs. PyTorch models can then be loaded and written
    from scratch, analyzed, and trained using local hardware. Trainings can be run
    simultaneously and compared to identify the best performing models, and export
    them as a trained TorchScript or ONNX model.

    We present Q&Aid, a conversation agent that relies on a series of machine
    learning models to filter, label, and answer medical questions based on a provided
    image and text inputs. Q&Aid is simplifying the hospital logic backend by standardizing
    it to a Health Intel Provider (HIP). A HIP is a collection of models trained on
    local data that receives text and visual input, afterward filtering, labeling,
    and feeding the data to the right models and generating at the end output for
    the aggregator. Any hospital is identified as a HIP holding custom models and
    labeling based on its knowledge. The hospitals are training and fine-tuning their
    models, such as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, on private data (e.g.
    brain anomaly segmentation). We aggregate all of the tasks that the hospitals
    can provide into a single chat app, offering the results to the user. When the
    chat ends, the transcript is forwarded to each hospital, a doctor being in charge
    of the final decision.

    "We present a unifying framework for the vector embedding problem:
    given a set of items and some known relationships between them, we seek a representation
    of the items by vectors, possibly subject to some constraints (e.g., requiring
    the vectors to have zero mean and identity covariance). We want the vectors associated
    with similar items to be near each other, and vectors associated with dissimilar
    items to not be near, measured in Euclidean distance. We formalize this by introducing
    distortion functions, defined for some pairs of the items. Our goal is to choose
    an embedding that minimizes the total distortion, subject to the constraints.
    We call this the minimum-distortion embedding (MDE) problem. The MDE framework
    generalizes many well-known embedding methods, such as PCA, the Laplacian eigenmap,
    multidimensional scaling, UMAP, and others, and also includes new types of embeddings.


    Our accompanying software library, PyMDE, makes it easy for users to specify and
    approximately solve MDE problems, enabling experimentation with well-known and
    custom embeddings alike. By making use of automatic differentiation and hardware
    acceleration via PyTorch, we are able to scale to very large embedding problems.
    We will showcase examples of embedding real datasets, including an academic co-authorship
    network, single-cell mRNA transcriptomes, US census data, and population genetics."

    "Processing of medical images such as MRI or CT presents unique challenges
    compared to RGB images typically used in computer vision. These include a lack
    of labels for large datasets, high computational costs, and metadata to describe
    the physical properties of voxels. Data augmentation is used to artificially increase
    the size of the training datasets. Training with image patches decreases the need
    for computational power. Spatial metadata needs to be carefully taken into account
    in order to ensure a correct alignment of volumes.


    We present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient loading,
    preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images for deep
    learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard medical
    image processing libraries to efficiently process images during training of neural
    networks. TorchIO transforms can be composed, reproduced, traced and extended.
    We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation operations as well
    as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.


    TorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image processing
    pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments. It encourages
    open science, as it supports reproducibility and is version controlled so that
    the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity, the library is compatible

    With the extensive use of electronic records and the availability of
    historical patient information, predictive models that can help identify patients
    at risk based on their history at an early stage can be a valuable adjunct to
    clinician judgment. Deep learning models can better predict patients' outcomes
    by consuming their medical history regardless of the length and the complexity
    of such data. We used our Pytorch_EHR framework to train a model that can predict
    COVID-19 patient's health outcomes on admission. We used the Cerner Real-world
    COVID-19 (Q2) cohort which included information for 117,496 COVID patients from
    62 health systems. We used a cohort of 55,068 patients and defined our outcomes
    including mortality, intubation, and hospitalization longer than 3 days as binary
    outcomes. We feed the model with all diagnoses, medication, laboratory results,
    and other clinical events information available before or on their first COVID-19
    encounter admission date. We kept the data preprocessing at a minimum for convenience
    and practicality relying on the embedding layer that learns features representations
    from the large training set. Our model showed improved performance compared to
    other baseline machine learning models like logistic regression (LR). For in-hospital
    mortality, our model showed AUROC of 89.5%, 90.6%, and 84.3% for in-hospital mortality,
    intubation, and hospitalization for more than 3 days, respectively versus LR which

    \ a new technique to accurately predict the expected performance of a partial\
    \ schedule using a LSTM over carefully engineered features that describe each\
    \ DNN operator and their current scheduling choices. Leveraging these predictions\
    \ we are able to make these optimization decisions greedily and, without any executions\
    \ on the target hardware, rapidly identify an efficient schedule.\nThis techniques\

    "The two key components in a multi-task RL codebase are (i) Multi-task
    RL algorithms and (ii) Multi-task RL environments. We develop open-source libraries
    for both components. [MTRL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mtrl) provides
    components to implement multi-task RL algorithms, and [MTEnv](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mtenv)
    is a library to interface with existing multi-task RL environments and create
    new ones.


    MTRL has two building blocks: (i) single task policy and (ii) components to augment
    the single-task policy for multi-task setup. The ideal workflow is to start with
    a base policy and add multi-task components as they seem fit. MTRL enables algorithms
    like GradNorm, Distral, HiPBMDP, PCGrad, Soft Modularization, etc.


    MTEnv is an effort to standardize multi-task RL environments and provide better
    benchmarks. We extend the Gym API to support multiple tasks, with two guiding
    principles: (i) Make minimal changes to the Gym Interface (which the community
    is very familiar with) and (ii) Make it easy to port existing environments to
    MTEnv. Additionally, we provide a collection of commonly used multi-task RL environments
    (Acrobot, Cartpole, Multitask variant of DeepMind Control Suite, Meta-World, Multi-armed
    Bandit, etc.). The RL practitioner can combine its own environments with the MTEnv
    wrappers to add multi-task support with a small code change.


    MTRL and MTEnv are used in several ongoing/published works at FAIR."

    "Transfer learning has become the norm to get state-of-the-art results
    in NLP. Hugging Face provides you with tools to help you on every step along the
    way:


    - A free git-based shared hub with more than 7,500 PyTorch checkpoints, and more
    than 800 NLP datasets.

    - The ? Datasets library, to easily download the dataset, manipulate it and prepare
    it.

    - The ? Tokenizers library, that provides ultra-fast tokenizers backed by Rust,
    and converts text in PyTorch tensors.

    - The ? Transformers library, providing more than 45 PyTorch implementations of
    Transformer architectures as simple nn.Module as well as a training API.

    - The ? Accelerate library, a non-intrusive API that allows you to run your raw
    training loop on any distributed setup.


    The pipeline is then simply a six-step process: select a pretrained model from
    the hub, handle the data with Datasets, tokenize the text with Tokenizers, load
    the model with Transformers, train it with the Trainer or your own loop powered
    by Accelerate, before sharing your results with the community on the hub."

    Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is an active area of research
    with enormous potential. In contrast to model-free RL, MBRL algorithms solve tasks
    by learning a predictive model of the task dynamics, and use this model to predict
    the future and facilitate decision making. Many researchers have argued that MBRL
    can result in lower sample complexity, better generalization, as well as safer
    and more interpretable decisions. However, despite the surge in popularity and
    great potential of MBRL, there is currently no widely accepted library for facilitating
    research in this area. Since MBRL methods often involve the interplay of complex
    components such as probabilistic ensembles, latent variable models, planning algorithms,
    and even model-free methods, the lack of such a library raises the entry bar to
    the field and slows down research efforts. In this work we aim to solve this problem
    by introducing MBRL-Lib, a modular PyTorch toolbox specifically designed for facilitating
    research on model-based reinforcement learning. MBRL-Lib provides interchangeable
    options for training dynamics models and running planning algorithms, which can
    then be used in a mix and match fashion to create novel MBRL methods. The library
    also provides a set of utility functions to run common MBRL tasks, as well a set
    of diagnostics tools to identify potential issues while training dynamics models
    and control algorithms.

    Analyzing and improving large-scale deep learning model performance
    is an ongoing challenge that continues to grow in importance as the model sizes
    increase. Microsoft and Facebook collaborated to create a native PyTorch performance
    debugging tool called PyTorch Profiler. The profiler builds on the PyTorch autograd
    profiler foundation, adds a new high fidelity GPU profiling engine, and out-of-the-box
    bottleneck analysis tool in Tensorboard. New Profiler delivers the simplest experience
    available to date where users can profile their models without installing any
    additional packages and see results immediately in Tensorboard. Until today, beginner
    users of PyTorch may not have attempted to profile their models due to the task
    complexity. With the new bottleneck analysis tool, they will find profiling easy
    and accessible. Experienced users will be delighted by the detailed trace views
    which illustrate GPU kernel execution events and their relationship to the PyTorch
    operations. Come learn how to profile your PyTorch models using this new delightfully
    simple tool.

    For experimentation and the development of machine learning models,
    few tools are as approachable as PyTorch. However, when moving from research to
    production, some of the features that make PyTorch great for development make
    it hard to deploy. With the introduction of TorchScript, PyTorch has solid tooling
    for addressing some of the problems of deploying PyTorch models. TorchScript removes
    the dependency on Python and produces portable, self contained, static representations
    of code and weights. But in addition to portability, users also look to optimize
    performance in deployment. When deploying on NVIDIA GPUs, TensorRT, NVIDIA's deep
    learning optimizer, provides the capability to maximize performance of workloads
    by tuning the execution of models for specific target hardware. TensorRT also
    provides tooling for conducting further optimization through mixed and reduced
    precision execution and post training quantization (PTQ). We present TRTorch,
    a compiler for PyTorch and TorchScript targeting NVIDIA GPUs, which combines the
    usability of PyTorch with the performance of TensorRT and allows users to fully
    optimize their inference workloads without leaving the PyTorch ecosystem. It also
    simplifies conducting complex optimizations like PTQ by leveraging common PyTorch
    tooling. TRTorch can be used directly from PyTorch as a TorchScript Backend, embedded
    in an application or used from the command line to easily increase the performance
    of inference applications.

    '"This poster presents the ""parametrizations"" feature that will be
    added to PyTorch in 1.9.0.

    This feature allows for a simple implementation of methods like pruning, weight_normalization
    or spectral_normalization.

    More generally, it implements a way to have ""computed parameters"". This means
    that we replace a parameter `weight` in a layer with `f(weight)`, where `f` is
    an arbitrary module. In other words, after putting a parametrization `f` on `layer.weight`,
    `layer.weight` will return `f(weight)`.

    They implement a caching system, so that the value `f(weight)` is computed just
    once during the forward pass.

    A module that implements a parametrisation may also have a `right_inverse` method.
    If this method is present, it is possible to assign to a parametrised tensor.
    This is useful when initialising a parametrised tensor.

    This feature can be seen as a first step towards invertible modules. In particular,
    it may also help making distributions first-class citizens in PyTorch.

    Parametrisations also allows for a simple implementation of constrained optimisation.
    From this perspective, parametrisation maps an unconstrained tensor to a constrained
    space such as the space of orthogonal matrices, SPD matrices, low-rank matrices...
    This approach is implemented in the library GeoTorch (https://github.com/Lezcano/geotorch/)."'

    "When machine learning models are deployed to solve a given task, a

    addresses one aspect of the answer, namely drift detection, or whether the information

    - is still consistent with the one it was trained and evaluated on. In a nutshell,
    TorchDrift is designed to be plugged into PyTorch models and check whether they
    are operating within spec.

    TorchDrift's principles apply PyTorch's motto _from research to production_
    to drift detection: We provide a library of methods that canbe used as baselines
    or building blocks for drift detection research, as well as provide practitioners
    deploying PyTorch models in production with up-to-date methods and educational

    \ have been identified as a major source of petroleum products entering our oceans,\
    \ cumulatively exceeding the largest oil spills, such as the Exxon Valdez and\
    \ Deepwater Horizon spills, even when considered over short time spans. However,\
    \ we still don't have a good estimate of\n\u25CF How much oil is being discharged;\n\
    \u25CF Where the discharge is happening;\n\u25CF Who the responsible vessels are.\n\
    This makes it difficult to prevent and effectively respond to oil pollution that\
    \ can damage our marine and coastal environments and economies that depend on\
    \ them.\n\nIn this poster we will share SkyTruth's recent work to address these\
    \ gaps using machine learning tools to detect oil pollution events and identify\
    \ the responsible vessels when possible. We use a convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN) in a ResNet-34 architecture to perform pixel segmentation on all incoming\
    \ Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to classify slicks. Despite\
    \ the satellites' incomplete oceanic coverage, we have been detecting an average\
    \ of 135 vessel slicks per month, and have identified several geographic hotspots\
    \ where oily discharges are occurring regularly. For the images that capture a\
    \ vessel in the act of discharging oil, we rely on an Automatic Identification\
    \ System (AIS) database to extract details about the ships, including vessel type\
    \ and flag state. We will share our experience\n\u25CF Making sufficient training\
    \ data from inherently sparse satellite image datasets;\n\u25CF Building a computer\
    \ vision model using PyTorch and fastai;\n\u25CF Fully automating the process\
    \ in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.\nThe application has been running continuously\
    \ since August 2020, has processed over 380,000 Sentinel-1 images, and has populated\
    \ a database with more than 1100 high-confidence slicks from vessels. We will\
    \ be discussing preliminary results from this dataset and remaining challenges\
    \ to be overcome.\nLearn more at https://skytruth.org/bilge-dumping/"

    Unpaired image-to-image translation algorithms have been used for various
    computer vision tasks like style transfer and domain adaption. Such algorithms
    are highly attractive because they alleviate the need for the collection of paired
    datasets. In this poster, we demonstrate UPIT, a novel fastai/PyTorch package
    (built with nbdev) for unpaired image-to-image translation. It implements various
    state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation algorithms such as CycleGAN,
    DualGAN, UNIT, and more. It enables simple training and inference on unpaired
    datasets. It also comes with implementations of commonly used metrics like FID,
    KID, and LPIPS. It also comes with Weights-and-Biases integration for easy experiment
    tracking. Since it is built on top of fastai and PyTorch, it comes with support
    for mixed-precision and multi-GPU training. It is highly flexible, and custom
    dataset types, models, and metrics can be used as well. With UPIT, training and
    applying unpaired image-to-image translation only takes a few lines of code.

    Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has had remarkable success
    in imaging cellular structures with nanometer resolution, but the need for activating
    only single isolated emitters limits imaging speed and labeling density. Here,
    we overcome this major limitation using deep learning. We developed DECODE, a
    computational tool that can localize single emitters at high density in 3D with
    the highest accuracy for a large range of imaging modalities and conditions. In
    a public software benchmark competition, it outperformed all other fitters on
    12 out of 12 data-sets when comparing both detection accuracy and localization
    error, often by a substantial margin. DECODE allowed us to take live-cell SMLM
    data with reduced light exposure in just 3 seconds and to image microtubules at
    ultra-high labeling density. Packaged for simple installation and use, DECODE
    will enable many labs to reduce imaging times and increase localization density
    in SMLM.

    This work presents Kornia, an open source computer vision library built
    upon a set of differentiable routines and modules that aims to solve generic computer
    vision problems. The package uses PyTorch as its main backend, not only for efficiency
    but also to take advantage of the reverse auto-differentiation engine to define
    and compute the gradient of complex functions. Inspired by OpenCV, Kornia is composed
    of a set of modules containing operators that can be integrated into neural networks
    to train models to perform a wide range of operations including image transformations,camera
    calibration, epipolar geometry, and low level image processing techniques, such
    as filtering and edge detection that operate directly on high dimensional tensor
    representations on graphical processing units, generating faster systems. Examples
    of classical vision problems implemented using our framework are provided including
    a benchmark comparing to existing vision libraries.

    Fisher Information Matrices (FIM) and Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK)
    are useful tools in a number of diverse applications related to neural networks.
    Yet these theoretical tools are often difficult to implement using current libraries
    for practical size networks, given that they require per-example gradients, and
    a large amount of memory since they scale as the number of parameters (for the
    FIM) or the number of examples x cardinality of the output space (for the NTK).
    NNGeometry is a PyTorch library that offers a high level API for computing various
    linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector products, trace, frobenius norm,
    and so on, where the matrix is either the FIM or the NTK, leveraging recent advances
    in approximating these matrices.

    "The seminal work of Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge gave birth to the field\
    \ of _Neural Style Transfer_ (NST) in 2016. An NST describes the merger between\
    \ the content and artistic style of two arbitrary images. This idea is nothing\
    \ new in the field of Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR). What distinguishes NST\
    \ from traditional NPR approaches is its generality: an NST only needs a single\
    \ arbitrary content and style image as input and thus \"makes -- for the first\
    \ time -- a generalized style transfer practicable\". Besides peripheral tasks,\
    \ an NST at its core is the definition of an optimization criterion called _perceptual\
    \ loss_, which estimates the perceptual quality of the stylized image. Usually\
    \ the perceptual loss comprises a deep neural network that needs to supply encodings\
    \ of images from various depths. \n\n`pystiche` is a library for NST written in\
    \ Python and built upon PyTorch. It provides modular and efficient implementations\
    \ for commonly used perceptual losses as well as neural net architectures. This\
    \ enables users to mix current state-of-the-art techniques with new ideas with\
    \ ease. This poster will showcase the core concepts of `pystiche` that will enable\
    \ other researchers as well as lay persons to got an NST running in minutes."

    " Deep Learning (DL) has greatly highlighted the potential impact of
    optimized machine learning in both the scientific

    and clinical communities. The advent of open-source DL libraries from major industrial
    entities, such as TensorFlow

    (Google), PyTorch (Facebook), further contributes to DL promises on the democratization
    of computational analytics. However, increased technical and specialized background
    is required to develop DL algorithms, and the variability of implementation details
    hinders their reproducibility. Towards lowering the barrier and making the mechanism
    of DL development, training, and inference more stable, reproducible, and scalable,
    without requiring an extensive technical background, this manuscript proposes
    the Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF). With built-in support
    for k-fold cross-validation, data augmentation, multiple modalities and output
    classes, and multi-GPU training, as well as the ability to work with both radiographic
    and histologic imaging, GaNDLF aims to provide an end-to-end solution for all
    DL-related tasks, to tackle problems in medical imaging and provide a robust application
    framework for deployment in clinical workflows.
