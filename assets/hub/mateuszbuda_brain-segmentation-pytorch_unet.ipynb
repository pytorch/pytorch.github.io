    "This U-Net model comprises four levels of blocks containing two convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation function, and one max pooling layer in the encoding part and up-convolutional layers instead in the decoding part.\n",

    "The buttleneck layer has 512 convolutional filters.\n",
    "From the encoding layers, skip connections are used to the corresponding layers in the decoding part.\n",
    "Input image is a 3-channel brain MRI slice from pre-contrast, FLAIR, and post-contrast sequences, respectively.\n",
