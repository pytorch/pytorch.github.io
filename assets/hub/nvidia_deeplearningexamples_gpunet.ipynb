    "### Model Description\n",
    "GPUNets are a new family of deployment and production ready Convolutional Neural Networks from NVIDIA auto-designed to max out the performance of NVIDIA GPU and TensorRT. \n",
    "\n",
    "Crafted by NVIDIA AI using novel Neural Architecture Search(NAS) methods, GPUNet demonstrates state-of-the-art inference performance up to 2x faster than EfficientNet-X and FBNet-V3. This notebook allows you to load and test all the the GPUNet model implementation listed in our [CVPR-2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00841.pdf). You can use this notebook to quickly load each one of listed models to perform inference runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the example below the pretrained ***GPUNet-0*** model is loaded by default to perform inference on image and present the result. You can switch the default pre-trained model loading from GPUNet-0 to one of these: GPUNet-1, GPUNet-2, GPUNet-P0, GPUNet-P1, GPUNet-D1 or GPUNet-D2.\n",
    "### Install pre-requisites\n",
    "To run the example you need some extra python packages installed. These are needed for preprocessing images and visualization."
