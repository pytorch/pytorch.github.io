    "\n",
    "In computer vision, generative models are networks trained to create images from a given input. In our case, we consider a specific kind of generative networks: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) which learn to map a random vector with a realistic image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "DCGAN is a model designed in 2015 by Radford et. al. in the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). It is a GAN architecture both very simple and efficient for low resolution image generation (up to 64x64).\n",
