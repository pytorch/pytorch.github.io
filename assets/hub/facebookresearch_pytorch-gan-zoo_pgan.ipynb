    "\n",
    "In computer vision, generative models are networks trained to create images from a given input. In our case, we consider a specific kind of generative networks: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) which learn to map a random vector with a realistic image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progressive Growing of GANs is a method developed by Karras et. al. [1] in 2017 allowing generation of high resolution images. To do so, the generative network is trained slice by slice. At first the model is trained to build very low resolution images, once it converges, new layers are added and the output resolution doubles. The process continues until the desired resolution is reached.\n",
