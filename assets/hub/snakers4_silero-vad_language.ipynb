    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Silero VAD: pre-trained enterprise-grade Voice Activity Detector (VAD), Number Detector and Language Classifier (95 languages). Enterprise-grade Speech Products made refreshingly simple (see our STT models). **Each model is published separately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are hardly any high quality / modern / free / public voice activity detectors except for WebRTC Voice Activity Detector (link). WebRTC though starts to show its age and it suffers from many false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(!!!) Important Notice (!!!)** - the models are intended to run on CPU only and were optimized for performance on 1 CPU thread. Note that the model is quantized.\n",

    "### Additional Examples and Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional examples and other model formats please visit this [link](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) and please refer to the extensive examples in the Colab format (including the streaming examples).\n",
