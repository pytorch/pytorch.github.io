    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Silero Text-To-Speech models provide enterprise grade TTS in a compact form-factor for several commonly spoken languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-line usage\n",
    "- Naturally sounding speech\n",
    "- No GPU or training required\n",
    "- Minimalism and lack of dependencies\n",
    "- A library of voices in many languages\n",
    "- Support for `16kHz` and `8kHz` out of the box\n",
    "- High throughput on slow hardware. Decent performance on one CPU thread\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Languages and Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this page update, the speakers of the following languages are supported both in 8 kHz and 16 kHz:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Russian (6 speakers)\n",
    "- English (1 speaker)\n",
    "- German (1 speaker)\n",
    "- Spanish (1 speaker)\n",
    "- French (1 speaker)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the always up-to-date language list, please visit our [repo](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) and see the `yml` [file](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/blob/master/models.yml) for all available checkpoints.\n",
