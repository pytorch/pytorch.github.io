    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Silero Speech-To-Text models provide enterprise grade STT in a compact form-factor for several commonly spoken languages. Unlike conventional ASR models our models are robust to a variety of dialects, codecs, domains, noises, lower sampling rates (for simplicity audio should be resampled to 16 kHz). The models consume a normalized audio in the form of samples (i.e. without any pre-processing except for normalization to -1 ... 1) and output frames with token probabilities. We provide a decoder utility for simplicity (we could include it into our model itself, but scripted modules had problems with storing model artifacts i.e. labels during certain export scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that our efforts with Open-STT and Silero Models will bring the ImageNet moment in speech closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Languages and Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this page update, the following languages are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- English\n",
    "- German\n",
    "- Spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the always up-to-date language list, please visit our [repo](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) and see the `yml` [file](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/blob/master/models.yml) for all available checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Examples and Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional examples and other model formats please visit this [link](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models). For quality and performance benchmarks please see the [wiki](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki). These resources will be updated from time to time.\n",
